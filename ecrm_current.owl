This implementation has been originally created by Bernhard Schiemann, Martin Oischinger and Günther Görz at the Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Department of Computer Science, Chair of Computer Science 8 (Artificial Intelligence) in cooperation with the Department of Museum Informatics of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum Nuremberg and the Department of Biodiversity Informatics of the Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig Bonn.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises signs, either meaningful or not, or arrangements of signs following a specific syntax, that are used or can be used to refer to and identify a specific instance of some class or category within a certain context.

Instances of E41 Appellation do not identify things by their meaning, even if they happen to have one, but instead by convention, tradition, or agreement. Instances of E41 Appellation are cultural constructs; as such, they have a context, a history, and a use in time and space by some group of users. A given instance of E41 Appellation can have alternative forms, i.e., other instances of E41 Appellation that are always regarded as equivalent independent from the thing it denotes.

Different languages may use different appellations for the same thing, such as the names of major cities. Some appellations may be formulated using a valid noun phrase of a particular language. In these cases, the respective instances of E41 Appellation should also be declared as instances of E33 Linguistic Object. Then the language using the appellation can be declared with the property P72 has language: E56 Language.

Instances of E41 Appellation may be used to identify any instance of E1 CRM Entity and sometimes are characteristic for instances of more specific subclasses E1 CRM Entity, such as for instances of E52 Time-Span (for instance “dates”), E39 Actor, E53 Place or E28 Conceptual Object. Postal addresses and E-mail addresses are characteristic examples of identifiers used by services transporting things between clients.

Even numerically expressed identifiers for extents in space or time are also regarded as instances of E41 Appellation, such as Gregorian dates or spatial coordinates, even though they allow for determining some time or location by a known procedure starting from a reference point and by virtue of that fact play a double role as instances of E59 Primitive Value.

E41 Appellation should not be confused with the act of naming something. Cf. E15 Identifier Assignment

Examples:
- "Martin" 
- “Aquae Sulis Minerva”
- "the Merchant of Venice" (E35) (McCullough, 2005)
- "Spigelia marilandica (L.) L." [not the species, just the name] (Hershberger, Robacker and Jenkins, 2015)
- "information science" [not the science itself, but the name through which we refer to it in an English-speaking context] 
- “安” [Chinese "an", meaning "peace"]
- “6°5’29”N 45°12’13”W” [example of spatial coordinate]
- “Black queen’s bishop 4” [chess coordinate, example of spatial coordinate]
- “19-MAR-1922” [example of date]
- “+41 22 418 5571” [example of contact point]
- "weasel@paveprime.com" [example of contact point]
- “CH-1211, Genève” [example of place appellation]
- “1-29-3 Otsuka, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 121, Japan” [example of a postal address]
- “the poop deck of H.M.S Victory” [example of a section definition on a human-made object (E22)]
- “the Venus de Milo’s left buttock” [example of a section definition on a human-made object (E22)]

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises items of a material nature that are units for documentation and have physical boundaries that separate them completely in an objective way from other objects.

The class also includes all aggregates of objects made for functional purposes of whatever kind, independent of physical coherence, such as a set of chessmen. Typically, instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy).

In some contexts, such objects, except for aggregates, are also called “bona fide objects” (Smith &amp; Varzi, 2000, pp.401-420), i.e., naturally defined objects.

The decision as to what is documented as a complete item, rather than by its parts or components, may be a purely administrative decision or may be a result of the order in which the item was acquired.


Examples: 
- Aphrodite of Milos (E22) (Kousser, 2005)
- the Cullinan Diamond (Scarratt and Shor, 2006)
- Apollo 13 at the time of launch (Lovell and Kluger, 1994)

  <owl:Class rdf:about="http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E8_Acquisition">
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises transfers of legal ownership from one or more instances of E39 Actor to one or more other instances of E39 Actor.

The class also applies to the establishment or loss of ownership of instances of E18 Physical Thing. It does not, however, imply changes of any other kinds of right. The recording of the donor and/or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E8 Acquisition there is either no donor or no recipient. Depending on the circumstances, it may describe:
1. the beginning of ownership
2. the end of ownership
3. the transfer of ownership
4. the acquisition from an unknown source
5. the loss of title due to destruction of the item

It may also describe events where a collector appropriates legal title, for example by annexation or field collection. The interpretation of the museum notion of "accession" differs between institutions. The CIDOC CRM therefore models legal ownership (E8 Acquisition) and physical custody (E10 Transfer of Custody) separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.


Examples:
- the collection of a hammer-head shark of the genus Sphyrna Rafinesque, 1810 (Carchariniformes) by John Steinbeck and Edward Ricketts at Puerto Escondido in the Gulf of Mexico on March 25th, 1940. (Steinbeck, 2000)
- the acquisition of El Greco’s painting entitled ‘The Apostles Peter and Paul’ by the State Hermitage in Saint Petersburg. (https://hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/01.+Paintings/32730)
- the loss of my stuffed chaffinch ‘Fringilla coelebs Linnaeus, 1758’ due to insect damage last year (fictitious)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises the births of human beings. E67 Birth is a biological event focussing on the context of people coming into life. (E63 Beginning of Existence comprises the coming into life of any living being).

Twins, triplets etc. are typically brought into life by the same instance of E67 Birth. The introduction of E67 Birth as a documentation element allows the description of a range of family relationships in a simple model. Suitable extensions may describe more details and the complexity of motherhood with the intervention of modern medicine. In this model, the biological father is not seen as a necessary participant in the birth.

Examples:
- the birth of Alexander the Great (Stoneman, 2004)

This class comprises concepts denoted by terms from thesauri and controlled vocabularies used to characterize and classify instances of CIDOC CRM classes. Instances of E55 Type represent concepts in contrast to instances of E41 Appellation which are used to name instances of CIDOC CRM classes.

E55 Type is the CIDOC CRM’s interface to domain specific ontologies and thesauri. These can be represented in the CIDOC CRM as subclasses of E55 Type, forming hierarchies of terms, i.e. instances of E55 Type linked via P127 has broader term (has narrower term): E55Type. Such hierarchies may be extended with additional properties. 

Examples:
- weight, length, depth [types of E54]
- portrait, sketch, animation [types of E36]
- French, English, German [E56]
- excellent, good, poor [types for instances of E3]
- Ford Model T, chop stick [types for instances of E22]
- cave, doline, scratch [types for instances of E26]
- poem, short story [types for instances of E33]
- wedding, earthquake, skirmish [types for instances of E5]

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises all persistent physical items of any size that are purposely created by human activity. This class comprises, besides others, Human-Made objects, such as a sword, and Human-Made features, such as rock art. For example, a “cup and ring” carving on bedrock is regarded as instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing.

Instances of Human-Made thing may be the result of modifying pre-existing physical things, preserving larger parts or most of the original matter and structure, which poses the question if they are new or even Human-Made, the respective interventions of production made on such original material should be obvious and sufficient to regard that the product has a new, distinct identity and intended function and is human-made. Substantial continuity of the previous matter and structure in the new product can be documented by describing the production process also as an instance of E81 Transformation.

Whereas interventions of conservation and repair are not regarded to produce a new Human-Made thing, the results of preparation of natural history specimens that substantially change their natural or original state should be regarded as physical Human-Made things, including the uncovering of petrified biological features from a solid piece of stone. On the other side, scribbling a museum number on a natural object should not be regarded to make it Human-Made. This notwithstanding, parts, sections, segments, or features of a physical Human-Made thing may continue to be non-Human-Made and preserved during the production process, for example natural pearls used as a part of an eardrop.

- the Forth Railway Bridge (Shipway, Bouch, Baker and Fowler, 1990).

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises activities that are designed to, and succeed in, creating one or more new items. 

It specializes the notion of modification into production. The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered “new” if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered “new” because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one.

This entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event. An event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.


Examples:
- the construction of the SS Great Britain (Gregor, 1971)
- the first casting of the Little Mermaid from the harbour of Copenhagen (Dewey, 2003)
- Rembrandt’s creating of the seventh state of his etching “Woman sitting half dressed beside a stove”, 1658, identified by Bartsch Number 197 (E12,E65,E81) (Hind, 1923)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises the activities that result in an instance of E18 Physical Thing being decreased by the removal of a part.

Typical scenarios include the detachment of an accessory, the removal of a component or part of a composite object, or the deaccessioning of an object from a curated collection, an instance of E78 Curated Holding. If the instance of E80 Part Removal results in the total decomposition of the original object into pieces, such that the whole ceases to exist, the activity should instead be modelled as an instance of E81 Transformation, i.e. a simultaneous destruction and production. In cases where the part removed has no discernible identity prior to its removal but does have an identity subsequent to its removal, the activity should be modelled as both an instance of E80 Part Removal and E12 Production. This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history, and continuity of identity over time, of objects that are removed from other objects, such as precious gemstones being extracted from different items of jewelry, or cultural artifacts being deaccessioned from different museum collections over their lifespan.

Examples:
- the removal of the engine from my car (fictitious)
- the disposal of object number 1976:234 from the collection (fictitious)

This class comprises the deaths of human beings.
If a person is killed, the death should be documented as an instance of both E69 Death and E7 Activity. The death or perishing of other living beings should be documented as instances of E64 End of Existence.

Examples:
- the murder of Julius Caesar (E69,E7) (Irwin, 1935)
- the death of Senator Paul Wellstone (Monast, 2003)

This class comprises textual strings that within a cultural context can be clearly identified as titles due to their form. Being a subclass of E41 Appellation, E35 Title can only be used when such a string is actually used as a title of a work, such as a text, an artwork, or a piece of music.

Titles are proper noun phrases or verbal phrases, and should not be confused with generic object names such as “chair”, “painting” or “book” (the latter are common nouns that stand for instances of E55 Type). Titles may be assigned by the creator of the work itself, or by a social group.

This class also comprises the translations of titles that are used as surrogates for the original titles in different social contexts.

Examples:
- “The Merchant of Venice” (McCullough, 2005)
- “Mona Lisa” (Mohen, 2006)
- “La Pie” (Bortolatto, 1981)
- “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” (Lennon, 1967)

This class comprises events that result in the formation of a formal or informal E74 Group of people, such as a club, society, association, corporation or nation.

E66 Formation does not include the arbitrary aggregation of people who do not act as a collective.

The formation of an instance of E74 Group does not require that the group is populated with members at the time of formation. In order to express the joining of members at the time of formation, the respective activity should be simultaneously an instance of both E66 Formation and E85 Joining.

Examples:
- the formation of the CIDOC CRM Special Interest Group
- the formation of the Soviet Union (Pipes, 1964)
- the conspiring of the murderers of Caesar (Irwin, 1935)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises transfers of physical custody of objects between instances of E39 Actor. 

The recording of the donor and/or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E10 Transfer of Custody there is either no donor or no recipient. Depending on the circumstances it may describe:
1. the beginning of custody
2. the end of custody
3. the transfer of custody
4. the receipt of custody from an unknown source
5. the declared loss of an object

The distinction between the legal responsibility for custody and the actual physical possession of the object should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). A specific case of transfer of custody is theft. The sense of physical possession requires that the object of custody is in the hands of the keeper at least with a part representative for the whole. The way, in which a representative part is defined, should ensure that it is unambiguous who keeps a part and who the whole and should be consistent with the identity criteria of the kept instance of E18 Physical Thing. For instance, in the case of a set of cutlery we may require the majority of pieces having been in the hands of the actor regardless which individual pieces are kept over time.

The interpretation of the museum notion of "accession" differs between institutions. The CIDOC CRM therefore models legal ownership and physical custody separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.


Examples:
- the delivery of the paintings by Secure Deliveries Inc. to the National Gallery
- the return of Picasso’s “Guernica” to Madrid’s Prado in 1981 (Chipp, 1988)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises extents in space, in particular on the surface of the earth, in the pure sense of physics: independent from temporal phenomena and matter.

The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks, but may also be determined by reference to mobile objetcts. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame.

It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance. 

Any instance of E18 Physical Thing can serve as a frame of reference for an instance of E53 Place. This may be documented using the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).

Examples:
- the extent of the UK in the year 2003
- the position of the hallmark on the inside of my wedding ring (fictitious)
- the place referred to in the phrase: "Fish collected at three miles north of the confluence of the Arve and the Rhone"
- here -&gt; &lt;- [the place between these two arrows in one of the reader's paper copy of this document. Each copy constitutes a different place of this spot.]

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises the actions of making assertions about one property of an object or any single relation between two items or concepts. The type of the property asserted to hold between two items or concepts can be described by the property P177 assigned property type: E55 Type.

For example, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain scientific/scholarly procedures, e.g., the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on whether this information should be accessible by structured queries.

This class allows for the documentation of how the respective assignment came about, and whose opinion it was. Note that all instances of properties described in a knowledge base are the opinion of someone. Per default, they are the opinion of the team maintaining the knowledge base. This fact must not individually be registered for all instances of properties provided by the maintaining team, because it would result in an endless recursion of whose opinion was the description of an opinion. Therefore, the use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment marks the fact, that the maintaining team is in general neutral to the validity of the respective assertion, but registers someone else’s opinion and how it came about.

All properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly relating the respective pair of items or concepts. Multiple use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment may possibly lead to a collection of contradictory values. 

All cases of properties in this model that are also described indirectly through a subclass of E13 Attribute Assignment are characterised as "short cuts" of a path via this subclass. This redundant modelling of two alternative views is preferred because many implementations may have good reasons to model either the action of assertion or the short cut, and the relation between both alternatives can be captured by simple rules.

Examples:
- the examination of MS Sinai Greek 418 by Nicholas Pickwoad in November 2003 (Honey &amp; Pickwoad , 2010)
- the assessment of the current ownership of Martin Doerr's silver cup in February 1997 (fictitious)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises transfers of legal ownership from one or more instances of E39 Actor to one or more different instances of E39 Actor, where the transferring party is completely compensated by the payment of a monetary amount. In more detail, a purchase agreement establishes a fixed monetary obligation at its initialization on the receiving party, to the giving party. An instance of E96 Purchase begins with the contract or equivalent agreement and ends with the fulfilment of all contractual obligations. In the case that the activity is abandoned before both parties have fulfilled these obligations, the activity is not regarded as an instance of E96 Purchase.

This class is a very specific case of the much more complex social business practices of exchange of goods and the creation and satisfaction of related social obligations. Purchase activities which define individual sales prices per object can be modelled by instantiating E96 Purchase for each object individually and as part of an overall instance of E96 Purchase transaction.

Examples: 
- the purchase of 10 okka of nails by the captain A. Syrmas on 18th September 1895 in Thessaloniki (Syrmas, 1896)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises abstract temporal extents, in the sense of Galilean physics, having a beginning, an end and a duration.

Instances of E52 Time-Span have no semantic connotations about phenomena happening within the temporal extent they represent. They do not convey any meaning other than a positioning on the “timeline” of chronology. The actual extent of an instance of E52 Time-Span can be approximated by properties of E52 Time-Span giving inner and outer bounds in the form of dates (instances of E61 Time Primitive). Comparing knowledge about time-spans is fundamental for chronological reasoning.

Some instances of E52 Time-Span may be defined as the actual, in principle observable, temporal extent of instances of E2 Temporal Entity via the property P4 has time-span (is time-span of): E52 Time-Span. They constitute phenomenal time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). Since our knowledge of history is imperfect and physical phenomena are fuzzy in nature, the extent of phenomenal time-spans can only be described in approximation. An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an instance of E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. It may, nevertheless, be associated with other descriptions by which we can infer knowledge about it, such as in relative chronologies.

Some instances of E52 may be defined precisely as representing a declaration of a temporal extent, as, for instance, done in a business contract. They constitute declarative time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013) and can be described via the property E61 Time Primitive P170 defines time (time is defined by): E52 Time-Span.

When used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it will nevertheless describe them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else is known.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises items that have persistent characteristics of structural nature substantially related to their identity and their integrity, sometimes known as “endurants” in philosophy. Persistent Items may be physical entities, such as people, animals or things, conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or even names.

Instances of E77 Persistent Item may be present or be part of interactions in different periods or events. They can repeatedly be recognized at disparate occasions during their existence by characteristics of structural nature. The respective characteristics need not be exactly the same during all the existence of an instance of E77 Persistent Item. Often, they undergo gradual change, still bearing some similarities with that of previous times, or dissappear completely and new emerge. For instance, a person, from the time of being born on, will gradually change all its features and acquire new ones, such as a scar. Even the DNA in different body cells will develop defects and mutations. Nevertheless, relevant characteristics use to be sufficiently similar to recognize the instance for some substantial period of time. 

The more specific criteria that determine the identity of instances of subclasses of E77 Persistent Item may vary considerably and are described of referred to in the respective scope notes. The decision about which exact criteria to use depends on whether the observable behaviour of the respective part of reality such confined conforms to the reasoning the user is interested in. For example, a building can be regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria, such as being bodily separated from other persons. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. On the opposite, the identity of a (version of a) text of a scientific publication is given by the exact arrangement of its relevant symbols.

The main classes of objects that fall outside the scope of the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties. 

An instance of E77 Persistent Item does not require actual knowledge of the identifying features of the instance being currently known. There may be cases, where the actual identifying features of an instance of E77 Persistent Item are not decidable at a particular state of knowledge. 

Examples:
- Leonard da Vinci (E21) (Strano, 1953)
- Stonehenge (E24) (Richards, 2005)
- the hole in the ozone layer (E4) (Hufford and Horwitz, 2005)
- the First Law of Thermodynamics (E89) (Craig and Gislason, 2002)

This class comprises instances of E7 Activity that are undertaken to create, alter or change instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing.

This class includes the production of an item from raw materials and other so far undocumented objects. It also includes the conservation treatment of an object.

Since the distinction between modification and production is not always clear, modification is regarded as the more generally applicable concept. This implies that some items may be consumed or destroyed in an instance of E11 Modification, and that others may be produced as a result of it. An event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities.

An activity undertaken on an object which was designed to alter it, but which, in fact, it did not in any seemingly significant way (such as the application of a solvent during conservation which failed to dissolve any part of the object), is still considered as an instance of E11 Modification. Typically, any such activity will leave at least forensic traces of evidence on the object.

If the instance of E29 Design or Procedure utilized for the modification prescribes the use of specific materials, they should be documented using property P68 foresees use of (use foreseen by): E57 Material of E29 Design or Procedure, rather than via P126 employed (was employed in): E57 Material.


Examples:
- the construction of the SS Great Britain (E12) (Gregor, 1971)
- the impregnation of the Vasa warship in Stockholm for preservation after 1956 (Håfors, 2010)
- the transformation of the Enola Gay into a museum exhibit by the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC between 1993 and 1995 (E12, E81) (Yakel, 2000)

This class comprises events that destroy one or more instances of E18 Physical Thing such that they lose their identity as the subjects of documentation.

Some destruction events are intentional, while others are independent of human activity. Intentional destruction may be documented by classifying the event as both an instance of E6 Destruction and of E7 Activity.

The decision to document an object as destroyed, transformed or modified is context sensitive:
1. If the matter remaining from the destruction is not documented, the event is modelled solely as an instance of E6 Destruction.
2. An event should also be documented as an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the original. In this case, the new items have separate identities. Matter is preserved, but identity is not.
3. When the initial identity of the changed instance of E18 Physical Thing is preserved, the event should be documented as an instance of E11 Modification.


Examples:
- the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD (Camardo, 2013)
- the destruction of Nineveh (E6, E7) (River, 2016)
- the breaking of a champagne glass yesterday by my dog (fictitious)

This class comprises actions measuring quantitative physical properties and other values that can be determined by a systematic, objective procedure of direct observation of particular states of physical reality.

An instance of E16 Measurement may us simple counting or tools, such as yardsticks or radiation detection devices. The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage. Methods and devices employed should be associated with instances of E16 Measurement by properties such as P33 used specific technique: E29 Design or Procedure, P125 used object of type: E55 Type, P16 used specific object (was used for): E70 Thing, whereas basic techniques such as "carbon 14 dating" should be encoded using P2 has type (is type of): E55 Type. Details of methods and devices reused or reusable in other instances of E16 Measurement should be documented for these entities rather than the measurements themselves, whereas details of particular execution may be documented by free text or by instantiating adequate sub-activities, if the detail may be of interest for an overarching query.

Regardless whether a measurement is made by an instrument or by human senses, it represents the initial transition from physical reality to information without any other documented information object in between within the reasoning chain that would represent the result of the interaction of the observer or device with reality. Therefore, determining properties of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is regarded as an instance of E13 Attribute Assignment, which may be inferred from observing and measuring representative carriers. In the case that the carrier can be named, the property P16 used specific object (was used for): should be used to indicate the instance(s) of E18 Physical Thing that was used as the empirical basis for the attribute assignment. For instance,  inferring properties of depicted items using image material, such as satellite images, is not regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement, but as a subsequent instance of E13 Attribute Assignment. Rather, only the production of the images, understood as arrays of radiation intensities, is regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement. The same reasoning holds for other sensor data.


Examples:
- measurement of height of silver cup 232 on the 31st  August 1997 (fictitious)
- the carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 [The carbon 14 dating of an approximately 400.000 year old complete Old Palaeolithic wooden spear found in Schoeningen, Niedersachsen, Germany, in 1995.] (Kouwenhoven, 1997)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises distinct, delimited and coherent processes and interactions of a material nature, in cultural, social or physical systems, involving and affecting instances of E77 Persistent Item in a way characteristic of the kind of process. Typical examples are meetings, births, deaths, actions of decision taking, making or inventing things, but also more complex and extended ones such as conferences, elections, building of a castle, or battles.

While the continuous growth of a tree lacks the limits characteristic of an event, its germination from a seed does qualify as an event. Similarly, the blowing of the wind lacks the distinctness and limits of an event, but a hurricane, flood or earthquake would qualify as an event. Mental processes are considered as events, in cases where they are connected with the material externalization of their results; for example, the creation of a poem, a performance or a change of intention that becomes obvious from subsequent actions or declarations.

The effects of an instance of E5 Event may not lead to relevant permanent changes of properties or relations of the items involved in it, for example an unrecorded performance. Of course, in order to be documented, some kind of evidence for an event must exist, be it witnesses, traces or products of the event.

While instances of E4 Period always require some form of coherence between its constituent phenomena, in addition, the essential constituents of instances of E5 Event should contribute to an overall effect; for example, the statements made during a meeting and the listening of the audience.

Viewed at a coarse level of detail, an instance of E5 Event may appear as if it had an ‘instantaneous’ overall effect, but any process or interaction of material nature in reality have an extent in time and space. At a fine level, instances of E5 Event may be analyzed into component phenomena and phases within a space and timeframe, and as such can be seen as a period, regardless of the size of the phenomena. The reverse is not necessarily the case: not all instances of E4 Period give rise to a noteworthy overall effect and are thus not instances of E5 Event.


Examples:
- the birth of Cleopatra (E67) (Pomeroy, 1984)
- the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD (E6) (Camardo, 2013)
- World War II (E7) (Barber, 1994)
- the Battle of Stalingrad (E7) (Hoyt, 1993)
- the Yalta Conference (E7) (Harbutt, 2010)
- my birthday celebration 28-6-1995 (E7)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises all phenomena, such as the instances of E4 Periods and E5 Events, which happen over a limited extent in time. This extent in time must be contiguous, i.e., without gaps. In case the defining kinds of phenomena for an instance of E2 Temporal Entity cease to happen, and occur later again at another time, we regard that the former instance of E2 Temporal Entity has ended and a new instance has come into existence. In more intuitive terms, the same event cannot happen twice.

In some contexts, such phenomena are also called perdurants. This class is disjoint from E77 Persistent Item and is an abstract class that typically has no direct instances. E2 Temporal Entity is specialized into E4 Period, which applies to a particular geographic area (defined with a greater or lesser degree of precision), and E3 Condition State, which applies to instances of E18 Physical Thing.


Examples:
- Bronze Age (E4) (Childe, 1963)
- the earthquake in Lisbon 1755 (E5) (Chester, 2001)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises activities that result in the allocation of an identifier to an instance of E1 CRM Entity. Instances of E15 Identifier Assignment may include the creation of the identifier from multiple constituents, which themselves may be instances of E41 Appellation. The syntax and kinds of constituents to be used may be declared in a rule constituting an instance of E29 Design or Procedure. 

Examples of such identifiers include Find Numbers, Inventory Numbers, uniform titles in the sense of librarianship and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). Documenting the act of identifier assignment and deassignment is especially useful when objects change custody or the identification system of an organization is changed. In order to keep track of the identity of things in such cases, it is important to document by whom, when and for what purpose an identifier is assigned to an item.

The fact that an identifier is a preferred one for an organisation can be expressed by using the property E1 CRM Entity. P48 has preferred identifier (is preferred identifier of): E42 Identifier. It can better be expressed in a context independent form by assigning a suitable E55 Type, such as “preferred identifier assignment”, to the respective instance of E15 Identifier Assignment via the P2 has type property.


Examples:
- Replacement of the inventory number TA959a by GE34604 for a 17th century lament cloth at the Museum Benaki, Athens
- Assigning the author-uniform title heading “Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, 1749-1832. Faust. 1. Theil.” for the respective work
- on June 1, 2001 assigning the personal name heading “Guillaume, de Machaut, ca. 1300-1377” to Guillaume de Machaut (Kelly, 2014)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.

It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an instance of E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.

Often, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical birth, an instance of E67 Birth, can be seen as both a single event, i.e., an instance of E5 Event, and as an extended period, i.e., an instance of E4 Period, that consists of multiple physical processes and complementary activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.

As the actual extent of an instance of E4 Period in spacetime we regard the trajectories of the participating physical things during their participation in an instance of E4 Period. This includes the open spaces via which these things have interacted and the spaces by which they had the potential to interact during that period or event in the way defined by the type of the respective period or event. Examples include the air in a meeting room transferring the voices of the participants. Since these phenomena are fuzzy, we assume the spatiotemporal extent to be contiguous, except for cases of phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas, including geopolitical units distributed over disconnected areas such as islands or colonies.

Whether the trajectories necessary for participants to travel between these areas are regarded as part of the spatiotemporal extent or not has to be decided in each case based on a concrete analysis, taking use of the sea for other purposes than travel, such as fishing, into consideration. One may also argue that the activities to govern disconnected areas imply travelling through spaces connecting them and that these areas hence are spatially connected in a way, but it appears counterintuitive to consider for instance travel routes in international waters as extensions of geopolitical units.


We model E4 Period as a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime Volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CIDOC CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel, 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an instance of E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomena while an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.

Typical use of this class in cultural heritage documentation is for documenting cultural and artistic periods. There are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period in the European sphere of influence lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.

A geopolitical unit as a specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena related to the claim of power, the consequences of belonging to a jurisdictional area and an administrative system that establishes a geopolitical unit. Examples from the modern period are countries or administrative areas of countries such as districts whose actions and structures define activities and phenomena in the area that they intend to govern. The borders of geopolitical units are often defined in contracts or treaties although they may deviate from the actual practice. The spatiotemporal properties of Geopolitical units can be modelled through the properties inherited from E92 Spacetime Volume. 

Another specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the actual extent of the set of activities and phenomena as evidenced by their physical traces that define a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.


Examples:
- Jurassic (Hallam, 1975)
- Populated Period of Nineveh
- Imperial Rome under Marcus Aurelius
- European Bronze Age (Harrison, c2004)
- Italian Renaissance (Macdonald, 1992)
- Thirty Years War (Lee, 1991)
- Sturm und Drang (Berkoff, 2013)
- Cubism (Cox, 2000)

This class comprises identifiable expressions in natural language or languages.

Instances of E33 Linguistic Object can be expressed in many ways: e.g. as written texts, recorded speech or sign language. However, the CRM treats instances of E33 Linguistic Object independently from the medium or method by which they are expressed. Expressions in formal languages, such as computer code or mathematical formulae, are not treated as instances of E33 Linguistic Object by the CRM. These should be modelled as instances of E73 Information Object.

In general, an instance of E33 Linguistic Object may also contain non-linguistic information, often of artistic or aesthetic value. Only in cases in which the content of an instance of E33 Linguistic Object can completely be expressed by a series of binary-encoded symbols, its content may be documented within a respective knowledge base by the property P190 has symbolic content: E62 String. Otherwise, it should be understood as an identifiable digital resource only available independently from the respective knowledge base. 

In other cases, such as pages of an illuminated manuscript or recordings containing speech in a language supported by a writing system, the linguistic part of the content of an instance of E33 Linguistic Object may be documented within a respective knowledge base in a note by P3 has note: E62 String. Otherwise, it may be described using the property P165 incorporates (is incorporated in): E73 Information Object as a different object with its own identity.

This class comprises the events that result in the simultaneous destruction of one or more than one instance of E18 Physical Thing and the creation of one or more than one instance of E18 Physical Thing that preserves recognizable substance and structure from the first one(s) but has fundamentally different nature or identity.

Although the old and the new instances of E18 Physical Thing are treated as discrete entities having separate, unique identities, they are causally connected through an instance of E81 Transformation. The creation of the new instances of E18 Physical Thing directly causes the destruction of the old instances of E18 Physical Thing using or preserving some relevant substance and structure. Instances of E81 Transformation are therefore distinct from re-classifications (documented as instances of E17 Type Assignment) or modifications (documented as instances of E11 Modification) of objects that do not fundamentally change their nature or identity. Characteristic cases of instances of E81 Transformation are reconstructions and repurposing of historical buildings or ruins, fires leaving buildings in ruins, taxidermy of specimens in natural history.

Even though such instances of E81 Transformation are often motivated by a change of intended use, substantial material changes should justify the documentation of the result as a new instance of E18 Physical Thing and not just the change of function. The latter may be documented as an extended activity (instance of E7 Activity) of using it.

Examples:
- the mummification of Tut-Ankh-Amun (E81, E12) [the mummification of the body of the deceased is a human production process and simultaneously preserves structures of the body at and before death] (Carter and Mace 1977)
- the death, carbonization and petrification of some people of Pompeii in 79AD by the intense heat of a pyroclastic cloud and ashes from the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius (E69, E81)
- the transformation of the Hephaisteion temple in Athens, better known as "Theseion", into a Christian church, dedicated to Saint George around AD 700 (E81,E12) [which actually helped preserving part of the antique temple structure from 449BC]

This class comprises activities that result in an instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing being increased, enlarged or augmented by the addition of a part.

Typical scenarios include the attachment of an accessory, the integration of a component, the addition of an element to an aggregate object, or the accessioning of an object into a curated instance of E78 Collection. Objects to which parts are added are, by definition, human-made, since the addition of a part implies a human activity. Following the addition of parts, the resulting human-made assemblages are treated objectively as single identifiable wholes, made up of constituent or component parts bound together either physically (for example the engine becoming a part of the car), or by sharing a common purpose (such as the 32 chess pieces that make up a chess set). This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history and continuity of identity of objects that are integrated into other objects over time, such as precious gemstones being repeatedly incorporated into different items of jewellery, or cultural artifacts being added to different museum instances of E78 Curated Holding over their lifespan.

Examples:
- the setting of the koh-i-noor diamond into the crown of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother (Dalrymple, 2017)
- the addition of the painting “Room in Brooklyn” by Edward Hopper to the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston

This class is a specialization of E55 Type and comprises the natural languages in the sense of concepts.

This type is used categorically in the model without reference to instances of it, i.e. the Model does not foresee the description of instances of instances of E56 Language, e.g.: “instances of Mandarin Chinese”.

It is recommended that internationally or nationally agreed codes and terminology are used to denote instances of E56 Language, such as those defined in ISO 639-1:2002 and later versions. 

Examples:
- el [Greek] (Palmer, 1980)
- en [English] (Wilson, 1983)
- eo [Esperanto] (Nuessel, 2000)
- es [Spanish] (Pineda, 1993)

This class comprises quantifiable properties that can be measured by some calibrated means and can be approximated by values, i.e. points or regions in a mathematical or conceptual space, such as natural or real numbers, RGB values etc.

An instance of E54 Dimension represents the empirical or theoretically derived quantity, including the precision tolerances resulting from the particular method or calculation. The identity of an instance of E54 Dimension depends on the method of its determination because each method may produce different values even when determining comparable qualities. For instance, the wingspan of a bird alive or dead is a different dimension. Thermoluninescence dating and Rehydroxylation [RHX] dating are different dimensions of temporal distance from now, even if they aim at dating the same object. The method of determination should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). Note that simple terms such as “diameter” or “length” are normally insufficient to unambiguously describe a respective dimension. In contrast, “maximum linear extent” may be sufficient.

The properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of instances of E54 Dimension adequate to the precision of the applied method of determination. If the respective quantity belongs to a non-discrete space according to the laws of physics, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that comparability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.

Numerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension as appropriate.


Examples:
- the weight of the Luxor Obelisk [250 metric tons]
- the vertical height of the statue of David by Michaelangelo [5.17 metres]
- the weight of the Great Star of Africa diamond [530.2 carats]
- the calibrated C14 date for the Shroud of Turin [AD1262-1312, 1303-1384]

This class comprises identifiable immaterial items, such as a poems, jokes, data sets, images, texts, multimedia objects, procedural prescriptions, computer program code, algorithm or mathematical formulae, that have an objectively recognizable structure and are documented as single units. The encoding structure known as a "named graph" also falls under this class, so that each "named graph" is an instance of E73 Information Object.

An instance of E73 Information Object does not depend on a specific physical carrier, which can include human memory, and it can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously.

Instances of E73 Information Object of a linguistic nature should be declared as instances of the E33 Linguistic Object subclass. Instances of E73 Information Object of a documentary nature should be declared as instances of the E31 Document subclass. Conceptual items such as types and classes are not instances of E73 Information Object, nor are ideas without a reproducible expression.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises any gatherings or organizations of human individuals or groups that act collectively or in a similar way due to any form of unifying relationship. In the wider sense this class also comprises official positions which used to be regarded in certain contexts as one actor, independent of the current holder of the office, such as the president of a country. In such cases, it may happen that the group never had more than one member. A joint pseudonym (i.e., a name that seems indicative of an individual but that is actually used as a persona by two or more people) is a particular case of E74 Group.

A gathering of people becomes an instance of E74 Group when it exhibits organizational characteristics usually typified by a set of ideas or beliefs held in common, or actions performed together. These might be communication, creating some common artifact, a common purpose such as study, worship, business, sports, etc. Nationality can be modelled as membership in an instance of E74 Group. Married couples and other concepts of family are regarded as particular examples of E74 Group.

Examples:
- the impressionists (Wilson, 1983)
- the Navajo (Correll, 1972)
- the Greeks (Williams, 1993)
- the peace protestors in New York City on 15th February 2003
- Exxon-Mobil (Raymond, 2006)
- King Solomon and his wives (Thieberger, 1947)

This class comprises the activities that result in the continuity of management and the preservation and evolution of instances of E78 Curated Holding, following an implicit or explicit curation plan.

It specializes the notion of activity into the curation of a collection and allows the history of curation to be recorded.

Items are accumulated and organized following criteria like subject, chronological period, material type, style of art etc. and can be added or removed from an instance of E78 Curated Holding for a specific purpose and/or audience. The initial aggregation of items of a collection is regarded as an instance of E12 Production Event while the activity of evolving, preserving and promoting a collection is regarded as an instance of E87 Curation Activity.

Examples:
- the curation of Mikael Heggelund Foslie’s coralline red algae Herbarium 1876 – 1909 (when Foslie died), now at Museum of Natural History and Archaeology, Norway (Woelkerling et al., 2005)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">This class comprises all things in the universe of discourse of the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model.

It is an abstract concept providing for three general properties:
1. Identification by name or appellation, and in particular by a preferred identifier
2. Classification by type, allowing further refinement of the specific subclass an instance belongs to
3. Attachment of free text and other unstructured data for the expression of anything not captured by formal properties

All other classes within the CIDOC CRM are directly or indirectly specialisations of E1 CRM Entity. 


Examples:
- the earthquake in Lisbon 1755 (E5) (Chester, 2001)

This class comprises non-material products of our minds and other human produced data that have become objects of a discourse about their identity, circumstances of creation or historical implication. The production of such information may have been supported by the use of technical devices such as cameras or computers.

Characteristically, instances of this class are created, invented or thought by someone, and then may be documented or communicated between persons. Instances of E28 Conceptual Object have the ability to exist on more than one particular carrier at the same time, such as paper, electronic signals, marks, audio media, paintings, photos, human memories, etc.

They cannot be destroyed. They exist as long as they can be found on at least one carrier or in at least one human memory. Their existence ends when the last carrier and the last memory are lost. 


Examples:
- Beethoven’s “Ode an die Freude” (Ode to Joy) (E73) (Kershaw, 1999)
- the definition of “ontology” in the Oxford English Dictionary (E73) (Oxford University Press, 1989)
- the knowledge about the victory at Marathon carried by the famous runner (E89) (Lagos &amp; Karyanos, 2020)

[Explanation note: In the following examples we illustrate the distinction between a propositional object, its names and its encoded forms. The Maxwell equations (Ball, 1962) are a good example, because they belong to the fundamental laws of physics and their mathematical content yields identical, unambiguous results regardless formulation and encoding]

This class comprises changes of the physical location of the instances of E19 Physical Object.

Note, that the class E9 Move inherits the property P7 took place at (witnessed): E53 Place. This property should be used to describe the trajectory or a larger area within which a move takes place, whereas the properties P26 moved to (was destination of), P27 moved from (was origin of) describe the start and end points only. Moves may also be documented to consist of other moves (via P9 consists of (forms part of)), in order to describe intermediate stages on a trajectory. In that case, start and end points of the partial moves should match appropriately between each other and with the overall event.


Examples:
- the relocation of London Bridge from the UK to the USA. (Wildfang, 2005)
- the movement of the exhibition “Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh” between 15th September and 2nd November 2019.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This classes comprises types that stand as the models for instances of E22 Human-Made Object that are produced as the result of production activities using plans exact enough to result in one or more series of uniform, functionally and aesthetically identical and interchangeable items. The product type is the intended ideal form of the manufacture process. It is typical of instances of E22 that conform to an instance of E99 Product Type that its component parts are interchangeable with component parts of other instances of E22 made after the model of the same instance of E99. Frequently, the uniform production according to a given instance of E99 Product Type is achieved by creating individual tools, such as moulds or print Definition of the plates that are themselves carriers of the design of the product type. Modern tools may use the flexibility of electronically controlled devices to achieve such uniformity. The product type itself, i.e., the potentially unlimited series of aesthetically equivalent items, may be the target of artistic design, rather than the individual object. In extreme cases, only one instance of a product type may have been produced, such as in a "print on demand" process which was only triggered once. However, this should not be confused with industrial prototypes, such as car prototypes, which are produced prior to the production line being set up, or test the production line itself.


Examples:
- Volkswagen Type 11 (Beetle) (Rieger, 2013)
- Dragendorff 54 samian vessel
- 1937 Edward VIII brass threepenny bit
- Qin Crossbow trigger un-notched Part B (Bg2u) (Li, 2012)
- Nokia Cityman 1320 [The first Nokia mobile phone]

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises the intellectual or conceptual aspects of recognisable marks and images.

This class does not intend to describe the idiosyncratic characteristics of an individual physical embodiment of a visual item, but the underlying prototype. For example, a mark such as the ICOM logo is generally considered to be the same logo when used on any number of publications. The size, orientation and colour may change, but the logo remains uniquely identifiable. The same is true of images that are reproduced many times. This means that visual items are independent of their physical support.

The class E36 Visual Item provides a means of identifying and linking together instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing that carry the same visual symbols, marks or images etc. The property P62 depicts (is depicted by) between E24 Physical Human-Made Thing and depicted subjects (E1 CRM Entity) is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E24 Physical Human-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item, P138 represents (has representation) to E1 CRM Entity, which in addition captures the optical features of the depiction.

Examples:
- the visual appearance of Monet's "La Pie" (Bortolatto, 1981)
- the Coca-Cola logo (E34)
- the Chi-Rho (E37)
- the communist red star (E37)
- the surface shape of Auguste Rodin's statue "Le Penseur" [there exist more than 20 copies, even of different size. Therefore, this is a good example that it is only the common surface shape, an immaterial visual item, which justifies displaying these copies as works of Auguste Rodin. As usual practice, Rodin himself did not produce the bronze statue, but only the prototype model]

    <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >Scope note: 
This class comprises instances of E92 Spacetime Volume, whose temporal extent has been chosen in order to determine the spatial extent of a phenomenon over the chosen time-span. Respective phenomena may, for instance, be historical events or periods, but can also be the diachronic extent and existence of physical things. In other words, instances of this class fix a slice of another instance of E92 Spacetime Volume in time.

The temporal extent of an instance of E93 Presence typically is predetermined by the researcher so as to focus the investigation particularly on finding the spatial extent of the phenomenon by testing for its characteristic features. There are at least two basic directions such investigations might take. The investigation may wish to determine where something was during some time or it may wish to reconstruct the total passage of a phenomenon’s spacetime volume through an examination of discrete presences. Observation and measurement of features indicating the presence or absence of a phenomenon in some space allows for the progressive approximation of spatial extents through argumentation typically based on inclusion, exclusion and various overlaps.

Examples:
- the Roman Empire on 19 August AD 14 (Clare and Edwards, 1992)
- Johann Joachim Winckelmann’s whereabouts in December 1775 (Leppmann, 1970)
- Johann Joachim Winckelmann’s whereabouts from November 19 1755 until April 9 1768 (Leppmann, 1970)

This class comprises real persons who live or are assumed to have lived.

Legendary figures that may have existed, such as Ulysses and King Arthur, fall into this class if the documentation refers to them as historical figures. In cases where doubt exists as to whether several persons are in fact identical, multiple instances can be created and linked to indicate their relationship. The CIDOC CRM does not propose a specific form to support reasoning about possible identity.

In a bibliographic context, a name presented following the conventions usually employed for personal names will be assumed to correspond to an actual real person (an instance of E21 Person), unless evidence is available to indicate that this is not the case. The fact that a persona may erroneously be classified as an instance of E21 Person does not imply that the concept comprises personae. 


Examples:
- Tut-Ankh-Amun (Edwards and Boltin, 1979)
- Nelson Mandela (Brown and Hort, 2006)

This class comprises activities formally defining new types of items.

It is typically a rigorous scholarly or scientific process that ensures a type is exhaustively described and appropriately named. In some cases, particularly in archaeology and the life sciences, E83 Type Creation requires the identification of an exemplary specimen and the publication of the type definition in an appropriate scholarly forum. The activity modelled as an instance of E83 Type Creation is central to research in the life sciences, where a type would be referred to as a “taxon,” the type description as a “protologue,” and the exemplary specimens as “original element” or “holotype”.

Examples:
- creation of the taxon 'Penicillium brefeldianum’ (Dodge, 1933)
- addition of class E85 Joining to the CIDOC CRM

Instances of E37 Mark do not represent the actual image of a mark, but the abstract ideal (or archetype) as used for codification in reference documents forming cultural documentation.

This class specifically excludes features that have no semantic significance, such as scratches or tool marks. These should be documented as instances of E25 Human-Made Feature.

This class comprises identifiable symbols and any aggregation of symbols, such as characters, identifiers, traffic signs, emblems, texts, data sets, images, musical scores, multimedia objects, computer program code or mathematical formulae that have an objectively recognizable structure and that are documented as single units.

It includes sets of signs of any nature, which may serve to designate something, or to communicate some propositional content. An instance of E90 Symbolic Object may or may not have a specific meaning, for example an arbitrary character string.

In some cases, the content of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object may completely be represented by a serialized digital content model, such as a sequence of ASCII-encoded characters, an XML or HTML document, or a TIFF image. The property P3 has note and its subproperty P190 has symbolic content allow for the description of this content model. In order to disambiguate which symbolic level is the carrier of the meaning, the property P3.1 has type can be used to specify the encoding (e.g. "bit", "Latin character", RGB pixel).

- ‘ecognizabl’
- the “no-smoking” sign (E36)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises the units in which a monetary system, supported by an administrative authority or other community, quantifies and arithmetically compares all monetary amounts declared in the unit. The unit of a monetary system must describe a nominal value which is kept constant by its administrative authority and an associated banking system if it exists, and not by market value. For instance, one may pay with grams of gold, but the respective monetary amount would have been agreed as the gold price in US dollars on the day of the payment. Under this definition, British Pounds, U.S. Dollars, and European Euros are examples of currency, but “grams of gold” is not. One monetary system has one and only one currency. Instances of this class must not be confused with coin denominations, such as “Dime” or “Sestertius”. Non-monetary exchange of value in terms of quantities of a particular type of goods, such as cows, do not constitute a currency.

Examples:
- “As” [Roman mid republic]
- “Euro”, (Temperton, 1997)
- “US Dollar” (Rose, 1978)

This class comprises recognisable, texts attached to instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing.

The transcription of the text can be documented in a note by P3 has note: E62 String. The alphabet used can be documented by P2 has type: E55 Type. This class does not intend to describe the idiosyncratic characteristics of an individual physical embodiment of an inscription, but the underlying prototype. The physical embodiment is modelled in the CIDOC CRM as instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing.

The relationship of a physical copy of a book to the text it contains is modelled using E18 Physical Thing. P128 carries (is carried by): E33 Linguistic Object.

Examples:
- "keep off the grass" [on a sign stuck in the lawn of the quad of Balliol College, Oxford, UK]
- The text published in Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum V 895 (Mommsen, 1872)
- "Kilroy was here"

This class is a specialization of E55 Type and comprises the concepts of materials.

Instances of E57 Material may denote properties of matter before its use, during its use, and as incorporated in an object, such as ultramarine powder, tempera paste, reinforced concrete. Discrete pieces of raw-materials kept in museums, such as bricks, sheets of fabric, pieces of metal, should be modelled individually in the same way as other objects. Discrete used or processed pieces, such as the stones from Nefer Titi's temple, should be modelled as parts (cf. P46 is composed of (forms part of): E18 Physical Thing).

This type is used categorically in the model without reference to instances of it, i.e. the Model does not foresee the description of instances of instances of E57 Material, e.g.: “instances of gold”. 

It is recommended that internationally or nationally agreed codes and terminology are used.

Examples:
- Brick (Gurcke, 1987)
- Gold (Watson, 1990)
- Aluminium (Norman, 1986)
- Polycarbonate (Mhaske, 2011)
- Resin (Barton, 1992)

    <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >Scope note:
This class comprises 4 dimensional point sets (volumes) in physical spacetime (in contrast to mathematical models of it) regardless their true geometric forms. They may derive their identity from being the extent of a material phenomenon or from being the interpretation of an expression defining an extent in spacetime. Intersections of instances of E92 Spacetime Volume, E53 Place and E52 Timespan are also regarded as instances of E92 Spacetime Volume. An instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is either contiguous or composed of a finite number of contiguous subsets. Its boundaries may be fuzzy due to the properties of the phenomena it derives from or due to the limited precision up to which defining expression can be identified with a real extent in spacetime. The duration of existence of an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is its projection on time.

Examples:
- the extent in space and time of the Event of Caesar’s murder (Irwin, 1935)
- where and when the carbon 14 dating of the "Schoeninger Speer II" in 1996 took place (Kouwenhoven, 1997) 
- the spatio-temporal trajectory of the H.M.S. Victory from its building to its actual location (Goodwin, 2015)
- the extent in space and time defined by a polygon approximating the Danube river flood in Austria between 6th and 9th of August 2002

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises identifiable features that are physically attached in an integral way to particular physical objects.

Instances of E26 Physical Feature share many of the attributes of instances of E19 Physical Object. They may have a one-, two- or three-dimensional geometric extent, but there are no natural borders that separate them completely in an objective way from the carrier objects. For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not.

Instances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colours, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature.

This definition coincides with the definition of "fiat objects" (Smith &amp; Varzi, 2000, pp.401-420), with the exception of aggregates of “bona fide objects”.


Examples:
- the cave of Dirou, Mani, Greece (Psimenos. 2005)
- the temple in Abu Simbel before its removal, which was carved out of solid rock (E25) (Hawass, 2000)
- Albrecht Duerer's signature on his painting of Charles the Great (E25) (Strauss, 1974)
- the damage to the nose of the Great Sphinx in Giza (Temple, 2009)
- Michael Jackson’s nose prior to plastic surgery

This class comprises immaterial items, including but not limited to stories, plots, procedural prescriptions, algorithms, laws of physics or images that are, or represent in some sense, sets of propositions about real or imaginary things and that are documented as single units or serve as topic of discourse.

This class also comprises items that are “about” something in the sense of a subject. In the wider sense, this class includes expressions of psychological value such as non-figural art and musical themes. However, conceptual items such as types and classes are not instances of E89 Propositional Object. This should not be confused with the definition of a type, which is indeed an instance of E89 Propositional Object.

Examples:
- Maxwell’s Equations (Ball, 1962)
- the ideational contents of Aristotle’s book entitled ‘Metaphysics’ as rendered in the Greek texts translated in Oxford edition
- the underlying prototype of any “no-smoking” sign (E36)
- the common ideas of the plots of the movie "The Seven Samurai" by Akira Kurosawa and the movie “The Magnificent Seven” by John Sturges (Mellen, 2002)
- the image content of the photo of the Allied Leaders at Yalta published by UPI, 1945 (E36)
- the character "Little Red Riding Hood", variants of which appear amongst others in Grimm brothers’ ‘Rotkäppchen’, other oral fairy tales and the film 'Hoodwinked'
- the place "Havnor" as invented by Ursula K. Le Guin for her ‘Earthsea’ book series, the related maps and appearing in derivative works based on these novels

This class comprises aggregations of instances of E18 Physical Thing that are assembled and maintained (“curated” and “preserved,” in museological terminology) by one or more instances of E39 Actor over time for a specific purpose and audience, and according to a particular collection development plan. Typical instances of curated holdings are museum collections, archives, library holdings and digital libraries. A digital library is regarded as an instance of E18 Physical Thing because it requires keeping physical carriers of the electronic content.

Items may be added or removed from an E78 Curated Holding in pursuit of this plan. This class should not be confused with the E39 Actor maintaining the E78 Curated Holding often referred to with the name of the E78 Curated Holding (e.g. “The Wallace Collection decided…”). 

Collective objects in the general sense, like a tomb full of gifts, a folder with stamps or a set of chessmen, should be documented as instances of E19 Physical Object, and not as instances of E78 Curated Holding. This is because they form wholes either because they are physically bound together or because they are kept together for their functionality.

Examples:
- the John Clayton Herbarium (Blake, 1918), (Natural History Museum, 2021)
- the Wallace Collection (Ingamells, 1990)
- Mikael Heggelund Foslie’s coralline red algae Herbarium at Museum of Natural History and Archaeology, Trondheim, Norway (Woelkerling et al., 2005)

This class comprises documented plans for the execution of actions in order to achieve a result of a specific quality, form or contents. In particular, it comprises plans for deliberate human activities that may result in new instances of E71 Human-Made Thing or for shaping or guiding the execution of an instance of E7 Activity.

Instances of E29 Design or Procedure can be structured in parts and sequences or depend on others.

This is modelled using P69 has association with (is associated with): E29 Design or Procedure 

Designs or procedures can be seen as one of the following
1. A schema for the activities it describes.
2. A schema of the products that result from their application.
3. An independent intellectual product that may have never been applied, such as Leonardo da Vinci’s famous plans for flying machines.

Because designs or procedures may never be applied or only partially executed, the CIDOC CRM models a loose relationship between the plan and the respective product.


Examples:
- the ISO standardisation procedure
- the musical notation of Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" (Kershaw, 1999)
- the architectural drawings for the Kölner Dom (Cologne Cathedral) in Cologne, Germany (Wolff, 1999)

This class comprises the states of objects characterised by a certain condition over a time-span.

An instance of this class describes the prevailing physical condition of any material object or feature during a specific instance of E52 Time Span. In general, the time-span for which a certain condition can be asserted may be shorter than the real time-span, for which this condition held. 

The nature of that condition can be described using P2 has type. For example, the instance of E3 Condition State "condition of the SS Great Britain between 22 September 1846 and 27 August 1847" can be characterized as an instance "wrecked" of E55 Type.


Examples:
-  the "reconstructed" state of the “Amber Room” in Tsarskoje Selo from summer 2003 until now (Owen, 2009)
- the "ruined" state of Peterhof Palace near Saint Petersburg from 1944 to 1946 (Maddox, 2015)

This general class comprises discrete, identifiable, instances of E77 Persistent Item that are documented as single units, that either consist of matter or depend on being carried by matter and are characterized by relative stability.

They may be intellectual products or physical things. They may for instance have a solid physical form, an electronic encoding, or they may be a logical concept or structure.

Examples:
- my photograph collection (E78) (fictitious)
- the bottle of milk in my refrigerator (E22) (fictitious)
- the Riss A1 plan of the Straßburger Münster (French: Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Strasbourg) (E29) (Liess, R., 1985)
- the thing on the top of Otto Hahn’s desk (E19)
- the form of the no-smoking sign (E36)

This class comprises quantities of monetary possessions or obligations in terms of their nominal value with respect to a particular currency. These quantities may be abstract accounting units, the nominal value of a heap of coins or bank notes at the time of validity of the respective currency, the nominal value of a bill of exchange or other documents expressing monetary claims or obligations. It specifically excludes amounts expressed in terms of weights of valuable items, like gold and diamonds, and quantities of other non-currency items, like goats or stocks and bonds.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises all persistent physical items with a relatively stable form, human-made or natural.

Depending on the existence of natural boundaries of such things, the CIDOC CRM distinguishes the instances of E19 Physical Object from instances of E26 Physical Feature, such as holes, rivers, pieces of land etc. Most instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy), whereas features are integral to the surrounding matter.

An instance of E18 Physical Thing occupies not only a particular geometric space at any instant of its existence, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces, such as the interior of a box. For the purpose of more detailed descriptions of the presence of an instance of E18 Physical Thing in space and time it can be associated with its specific instance of E92 Spacetime Volume by the property P196 defines (is defined by). 

The CIDOC CRM is generally not concerned with amounts of matter in fluid or gaseous states, as long as they are not confined in an identifiable way for an identifiable minimal time-span.


Examples:
- the Cullinan Diamond (E19) (Scarratt and Shor, 2006)
- the cave “Ideon Andron” in Crete (E26) (Smith, 1844-49)
- the Mona Lisa (E22) (Mohem, 2006)

This class comprises events that end the existence of any instance of E77 Persistent Item.

It may be used for temporal reasoning about things (physical items, groups of people, living beings) ceasing to exist; it serves as a hook for determination of a “terminus post quem” or “terminus ante quem”. In cases where substance from an instance of E64 Persistent Item continues to exist in a new form, the process would be documented as instances of E81 Transformation.

Examples:
- the death of Snoopy, my dog(fictitious)
- the melting of the snowman (E6)
- the burning of the Temple of Artemis in Ephesos by Herostratos in 356BC (E7, E6) (Trell, 1945)

This class comprises those material or immaterial items to which instances of E30 Right, such as the right of ownership or use, can be applied.

This is true for all instances of E18 Physical Thing. In the case of instances of E28 Conceptual Object, however, the identity of an instance of E28 Conceptual Object or the method of its use may be too ambiguous to reliably establish instances of E30 Right, as in the case of taxa and inspirations. Ownership of corporations is currently regarded as out of scope of the CIDOC CRM.

    >Scope note:
This property associates an instance of E53 Place with the instance of E18 Physical Thing that determines a reference space for this instance of E53 Place by being at rest with respect to this reference space. The relative stability of form of an instance of E18 Physical Thing defines its default reference space. The reference space is not spatially limited to the referred thing. For example, a ship determines a reference space in terms of which other ships in its neighbourhood may be described. Larger constellations of matter, such as continental plates, may comprise many physical features that are at rest with them and define the same reference space. 

Examples:
- The spatial extent of the municipality of Athens in 2014 (E53) is at rest relative to The Royal Observatory in Greenwich (E25). (Maunder, 1900)
- The place where Lord Nelson died on H.M.S. Victory (E53) is at rest relative to H.M.S. Victory (E22). (Adkin, 2005)

This property identifies an origin, an instance of E53 Place, of an instance of E9 Move.

A move will be linked to an origin, such as the move of an artifact from storage to display. A move may be linked to many starting instances of E53 Place by multiple instances of this property. In this case the move describes the picking up of a set of objects. The area of the move includes the origin(s), route and destination(s).

Therefore, the described origin is an instance of E53 Place which P89 falls within (contains) the instance of E53 Place the move P7 took place at.

Examples:
- The movement of the exhibition "Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh" between 15th of September and 2nd of November 2019 (E9) moved from Paris, Grande Halle de la Villette (E53).

In a model with fuzzy borders, this property will not be transitive.

Examples:
- The production of the scarab seal found in Poros in a context of LMIIIB (E12) starts after or with the start of Tutankhamun period (1332-1323 B.C) (E4). [The scarab stamp seal found in Poros was associated with finds dated to the LMIIIB period. The seal is dated to the Tutankhamun period or later because it belongs to the scarabs of type “nh.s n Jmn”: During Akhenaten period, the production of this type of scarab seal stopped (the name of Amun is not referred to during his reign). Therefore, the scarab cannot have been produced before the Tutankhamun period and is probably a later production] (Karetsou, 2000)
- The production of the cylindrical seal of the first Dynasty of Babylon found in Tholos B in Platanos (E12) starts after or with the start of the Hammurabi period of the kingdom (E4). [Of the cylindrical seal of the first Dynasty of Babylon found in tholos B in Platanos believed to connect king Hammurabi with the MM I period. Specifically, although the finding is believed to have been found in a MM I layer, it contained material from the MM III/YM I period. Therefore, the seal may be from the Hammurabi period or, it may be from a later period.] (Walberg, 1992.)

    >Scope Note: 	
This property relates one instance of E18 Physical Thing which acts as a container or support to a supported or contained instance of E18 Physical Thing. Typical examples of E18 Physical Things which are intended to function as a container or support include shelves, folders or boxes. These containers or supports provide a stable surface which is intended for other physical objects to be placed upon for storage, display, transport or other similar functions.

This property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P59 has section, E53 Place, P53i is former or current location of, to E18 Physical Thing. It is not a sub-property of P46 is composed of, as the held or supported object is not a component of the container or support.

This property can be used to avoid explicitly instantiating the E53 Place which is defined by an instance of E18 Physical Thing, especially when the only intended use of that instance of E18 Physical Thing is to act as a container or surface for the storage of other instances of E18 Physical Thing. The place’s existence is defined by the existence of the container or surface, and will go out of existence at the same time as the destruction of the container or surface. 

This property is transitive.

- Archival folder “6” (E22) holds or supports the piece of paper carrying the text of a letter from Lawrence Alloway to Sylvia Sleigh (E22).

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This property generalises the notions of "copy of" and "similar to" into a directed relationship, where the domain expresses the derivative or influenced item and the range the source or influencing item, if such a direction can be established. The property can also be used to express similarity in cases that can be stated between two objects only, without historical knowledge about its reasons. The property expresses a symmetric relationship in case no direction of influence can be established either from evidence on the item itself or from historical knowledge. This holds in particular for siblings of a derivation process from a common source or non-causal cultural parallels, such as some weaving patterns.

The P130.1 kind of similarity property of the P130 shows features of (features are also found on) property enables the relationship between the domain and the range to be further clarified, in the sense from domain to range, if applicable. For example, it may be expressed if both items are product “of the same mould”, or if two texts “contain identical paragraphs”. 

If the reason for similarity is a sort of derivation process, i.e., that the creator has used or had in mind the form of a particular thing during the creation or production, this process should be explicitly modelled. In these cases, P130 shows features of can be regarded as a shortcut of such a process. However, the current model does not contain any path specific enough to infer this property. Specializations of the CIDOC CRM may however be more explicit, for instance describing the use of moulds etc.

This property is not transitive.

Examples:
- Mary Lamb’s Cymbeline from Charles and Mary Lamb’s Tales from Shakespeare (E89) shows features of William Shakespeare’s Cymbeline (E89). (Carrington, 1954)
- The audio recording of Dante Alighieri's La divina commedia read by Enrico de Negri (E73) shows features of the text of Dante Alighieri's La divina commedia (E89). (Alighieri, 1956)

This property associates an instance of E1 CRM Entity with an instance of E55 Type for which it has been declared to be a particularly characteristic example.

The P137.1 in the taxonomic role property of P137 exemplifies (is exemplified by) allows differentiation of taxonomic roles. The taxonomic role renders the specific relationship of this example to the type, such as "prototypical", "archetypical", "lectotype", etc. The taxonomic role "lectotype" is not associated with the instance of E83 Type Creation itself but is selected in a later phase.

Examples:
- Object BM000098044 of the Clayton Herbarium (E20) exemplifies ‘Spigelia marilandica’ (L.) L. (E55) in the taxonomic role lectotype (E55). (Natural History Museum, 2021)

    >Scope note:
This property associates an instance of E13 Attribute Assignment with the type of property or relation that this assignment maintains to hold between the item to which it assigns an attribute and the attribute itself.
Note that the properties defined by the CIDOC CRM also constitute instances of E55 Type themselves. The direction of the assigned property type is understood to be from the attributed item (the range of property P140 assigned attribute to) to the attribute item (the range of the property P141 assigned). More than one property type may be assigned to hold between two items.

A comprehensive explanation about refining CIDOC CRM concepts by E55 Type is given in the section “About Types” in the section on “Specific Modelling Constructs” of this document.

Examples:
- The Current Ownership Assessment of Martin Doerr’s silver cup February 1997 (E13) assigned property type P52 has former or current owner (is former or current keeper of) (E55). (fictitious)
- 01 June 1997 Identifier Assignment of the silver cup donated by Martin Doerr (E15) assigned property type P48 has preferred identifier (is preferred identifier of) (E55). (fictitious)
- The examination of MS Sinai Greek 418 (E13) assigned property type binding structure type (E55). [‘binding structure type’ refers to a property, external to the CIDOC CRM, which connects a book (E22) to the type of its binding structure (E55)] (Honey &amp; Pickwoad, 2010)
- The condition assessment of the endband cores of MS Sinai Greek 418 (E14) assigned property type damage (E55.) [‘damage’ refers to a property, external to the CIDOC CRM, which connects an instance of a physical thing like an endband core (E22) to the type of damage (E55) it shows] (Honey &amp; Pickwoad, 2010)
- The condition assessment of the cover of MS Sinai Greek 418 (E14) assigned property type quality (E55). [‘quality’ refers to a property, external to the CIDOC CRM, which connects an instance of a physical thing like a book cover (E22) to its quality (E55)] (Honey and Pickwoad, 2010)

    >Scope note: 
This property associates an instance of E53 Place with another instance of E53 Place, which is defined in the same reference space, and which is used to approximate the former. The property does not necessarily state the quality or accuracy of this approximation, but rather indicates the use of the first instance of place to approximate the second.

In common documentation practice, find or encounter spots e.g. in archaeology, botany or zoology are often related to the closest village, river or other named place without detailing the relation, e.g. if it is located within the village or in a certain distance of the specified place. In this case the stated “phenomenal” place found in the documentation can be seen as approximation of the actual encounter spot without more specific knowledge.

In more recent documentation often point coordinate information is provided that originates from GPS measurements or georeferencing from a map. This point coordinate information does not state the actual place of the encounter spot but tries to approximate it with a “declarative” place. The accuracy depends on the methodology used when creating the coordinates. It may be dependent on technical limitations like GPS accuracy but also on the method where the GPS location is taken in relation to the measured feature. If the methodology is known a maximum deviation from the measured point can be calculated and the encounter spot or feature may be related to the resulting circle using an instance of P171 at some place within.

This property is not transitive.

Examples:
- [40°31'17.9"N 21°15'48.3"E] (E53) approximates Kastoria, Greece, TGN ID: 7010880 (E53). [The approximating declarative place with point shape is defined in terms of coordinates taken from https://sws.geonames.org/735927]
- [40°31'00.1"N 21°16'00.1"E] (E53) approximates Kastoria, Greece, TGN ID: 7010880 (E53). [The approximating declarative place with point shape is defined in terms of coordinates taken from http://vocab.getty.edu/page/tgn/7010880]
- [40°04'60.0"N 22°21'00.0"E] (E53) approximates Mount Olympus National Park, Greece (E53). [The approximating declarative place with point shape is defined in terms of coordinates taken from https://www.geonames.org/6941814]

This property identifies one or more instances of E1 CRM Entity that were used as evidence to declare a new instance of E55 Type.

The examination of these items is often the only objective way to understand the precise characteristics of a new type. Such items should be deposited in a museum or similar institution for that reason. The taxonomic role renders the specific relationship of each item to the type, such as "holotype" or "original element".

Examples:
- The taxon creation of the plant species ‘Serratula glauca Linné, 1753.’ (E83) was based on Object BM000576251 of the Clayton Herbarium (E20) in the taxonomic role original element (E55). (Blake, 1918)

This property identifies a destination, an instance of E53 place, of an instance of E9 Move.

A move will be linked to a destination, such as the move of an artifact from storage to display. A move may be linked to many terminal instances of E53 Place by multiple instances of this property. In this case the move describes a distribution of a set of objects. The area of the move includes the origin(s), route and destination(s).

Therefore, the described destination is an instance of E53 Place which P89 falls within (contains) the instance of E53 Place the move P7 took place at.

In other words, if A = [Astart, Aend] and B = [Bstart, Bend], we mean Astart &lt; Bend is true. 

This property is part of the set of temporal primitives P173 – P176, P182 – P185.
	
This property corresponds to a disjunction (logical OR) of the following Allen temporal relations (Allen, 1983): {before, meets, overlaps, starts, started-by, contains, finishes, finished-by, equals, during, overlapped by}

Typically, this property is a consequence of a known influence of some event on another event or activity, such as a novel written by someone being continued by someone else, or the knowledge of a defeat on a distant battlefield causing people to end their ongoing activities. This property is not transitive.

Examples:
- The settling activity of the city of Assur (Ashur) (E7) starts before the end of The Tenth Dynasty of Egypt (E4). [There are some 200 - 300 years differences in the chronology of the First Intermediate Period, and Assur is dated to "about 2500 BC”.] (Pedersén, 1986)

    >Scope note:
This property associates an instance of an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume with an instance of E53 Place that is the result of the spatial projection of the instance of the E92 Spacetime Volume on a reference space.

In general there can be more than one useful reference space (for reference space see P156 occupies and P157 is at rest relative to) to describe the spatial projection of a spacetime volume, for example, in describing a sea battle, the difference between the battle ship and the seafloor as reference spaces. Thus it can be seen that the projection is not unique.

The spatial projection is the actual spatial coverage of a spacetime volume, which normally has fuzzy boundaries except for instances of E92 Spacetime Volumes which are geometrically defined in the same reference system as the range of this property are an exception to this and do not have fuzzy boundaries. Modelling explicitly fuzzy spatial projections serves therefore as a common topological reference of different spatial approximations rather than absolute geometric determination, for instance for relating outer or inner spatial boundaries for the respective spacetime volumes.

In case the domain of an instance of P161 has spatial projection is an instance of E4 Period, the spatial projection describes all areas that period was ever present at, for instance, the Roman Empire. 

This property is part of the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place, which in turn is implied by P156 occupies (is occupied by). 

This property is part of the fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within (contains) to E53 Place, which in turn is shortcut by P7 took place at (witnessed). 

Example:
- The Roman Empire (E4) has spatial projection all areas ever claimed by Rome (E53). (Clare &amp; Edwards, 1992)

It allows an instance of E52 Time-Span to be associated with an instance of E54 Dimension representing duration independent from the actual beginning and end. Indeterminacy of the duration value can be expressed by assigning a numerical interval to the property P90 has value of E54 Dimension.

This property specifies that the temporal extent of the domain instance A of E2 Temporal Entity starts definitely before the start of the temporal extent of the range instance B of E2 Temporal Entity. 
 In other words, if A = [Astart, Aend] and B = [Bstart, Bend], we mean Astart &lt; Bstart is true. 

This property is part of the set of temporal primitives P173 – P176, P182 – P185.

This property corresponds to a disjunction (logical OR) of the following Allen temporal relations [Allen, 1983]: {before, meets, overlaps, contains, finished-by}. This property is transitive.

This property associates an instance of E93 Presence with an instance of E53 Place that geometrically includes the spatial projection of the respective instance of E93 Presence. Besides others, this property may be used to state in which space an object has been for some known time, such as a room of a castle or in a drawer. It may also be used to describe a confinement of the spatial extent of some realm during a known time-span.

This property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E93 Presence through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within (contains) to E53 Place. 

Examples:
- Johann Joachim Winkelmann’s whereabouts in December 1755 (E93) was within Rome (E53). (Leppmann, 1970)
- Johann Joachim Winkelmann’s whereabouts from 19th November 19 1755 until 9th April 1768 (E93) was within Italy (E53). (Leppmann, 1970)

E29 Designs and procedures commonly foresee the use of particular instances of E57 Material. The fabrication of adobe bricks, for example, requires straw, clay and water. This property enables this to be documented.

This property is not intended for the documentation of instances of E57 Materials that were used on a particular occasion when an instance of E29 Design or Procedure was executed.

This symmetric property associates two instances of E92 Spacetime Volume that have some of their extents in common. If only the fuzzy boundaries of the instances of E92 Spacetime Volume overlap, this property cannot be determined from observation alone and therefore should not be applied. However, there may be other forms of justification that the two instances of E92 Spacetime Volume must have some of their extents in common regardless of where and when precisely. 

If this property holds for two instances of E92 Spacetime Volume then it cannot be the case that P133 is spatiotemporally separated from also holds for the same two instances. Furthermore, there are cases where neither P132 spatiotemporally overlaps with nor P133 is spatiotemporally separated from holds between two instances of E92 Spacetime Volume. This would occur where only an overlap of the fuzzy boundaries of the two instances of E92 Spacetime Volume occurs and no other evidence is available. 
This property is symmetric

    >Scope note: 
This property associates an instance of E73 Information Object with an instance of E90 Symbolic Object (or any of its subclasses) that was included in it.

This property makes it possible to recognise the autonomous status of the incorporated signs, which were created in a distinct context, and can be incorporated in many instances of E73 Information Object, and to highlight the difference between structural and accidental whole-part relationships between conceptual entities.

It accounts for many cultural facts that are quite frequent and significant: the inclusion of a poem in an anthology, the re-use of an operatic aria in a new opera, the use of a reproduction of a painting for a book cover or a CD booklet, the integration of textual quotations, the presence of lyrics in a song that sets those lyrics to music, the presence of the text of a play in a movie based on that play, etc.

In particular, this property allows for modelling relationships of different levels of symbolic specificity, such as the natural language words making up a particular text, the characters making up the words and punctuation, the choice of fonts and page layout for the characters.

When restricted to information objects, that is, seen as a property with E73 Information Object as domain and range the property is transitive.

A digital photograph of a manuscript page incorporates the text of a manuscript page, if the respective text is defined as a sequence of symbols of a particular type, such as Latin characters, and the resolution and quality of the digital image is sufficient to resolve these symbols so they are readable on the digital image.

Examples:	
- The content of Charles-Moïse Briquet’s ‘Les Filigranes: dictionnaire historique des marques du papier’ (E32) P165 incorporates the visual aspect of the watermark used around 1358-61 by some Spanish papermaker(s) and identified as ‘Briquet 4019’ (E37). (Briquet, 1985)
- The visual content of Jacopo Amigoni’s painting known as ‘The Singer Farinelli and friends’ (E36) P165 incorporates the musical notation of Farinelli’s musical work entitled ‘La Partenza’ (E73). (National Gallery of Victoria)
- The visual content of Nicolas Poussin’s painting entitled ‘Les Bergers d’Arcadie’ (E36) P165 incorporates the Latin phrase ‘Et in Arcadia ego’ (E33). (Wikipedia, 2020)

This property describes the temporal projection of an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume. The property P4 has time-span is the same as P160 has temporal projection if it is used to document an instance of E4 Period or any subclass of it.

Example:
- The spatio-temporal trajectory of the H.M.S. Temeraire from its building in 1798 to its destruction in 1838 (E92) has temporal projection The Time-Span of the existence of H.M.S. Temeraire (E52) [at some time within (P82) “1798-1838” (E61).] (Willis, 2010)
- The Battle of Waterloo 1815 (E7) has temporal projection the time-span of The Battle of Waterloo (E52) [at some time within (P82) “Sunday, 18th June 1815” (E61).] (Black, 2010)

This property relates an instance of E93 Presence with the instance of E52 Time-Span that defines the time-slice of the spacetime volume that this instance of E93 Presence is related to via the property P166 was a presence of (had presence).
	
There are two typical cases for the determination of the related instance of E52 Time-Span. In the first, it is the temporal extent of an instance of E2 Temporal Entity (documented with P4 has time-span (is time-span of)): this then documents the simultaneity of the instance of E93 Presence and the instance of E2 Temporal Entity, even if the absolute time-span is not known, and can be regarded as a phenomenal timespan. In the second, the instance of E52 Time-Span is a date range declared in or derived from historical sources or provided by dating methods: this is a declarative timespan.

Examples:
- 2016-02-09 (E52) temporally specifies the last day of the 2016 Carnival in Cologne (E93).
- Johann Joachim Winckelmann’s whereabouts in December 1755 (E93) is temporally specified by December 1755 (E52.) (Leppmann, 1970)
 Johann Joachim Winkelmann’s whereabouts from 19th November 1755 until 9th April 1768 (E93) is temporally specified by November 19th 1755 until 9th April 1768 (E52). (Leppmann, 1970)

Although a leaving activity normally concerns only one instance of E74 Group, it is possible to imagine circumstances under which leaving one E74 Group implies leaving another E74 Group as well.

Examples:

This property links an instance of E64 End of Existence to the instance of E77 Persistent Item taken out of existence by it.

In the case of immaterial things, the instance of E64 End of Existence is considered to take place with the destruction of the last physical carrier.

This allows an “end” to be attached to any instance of E77 Persistent Item being documented i.e., instances of E70 Thing, E72 Legal Object, E39 Actor, E41 Appellation and E55 Type. For many instances of E77 Persistent Item we know the maximum life-span and can infer, that they must have ended to exist. We assume in that case an instance of E64 End of Existence, which may be as unnoticeable as forgetting the secret knowledge by the last representative of some indigenous nation.

This property links an instance of E69 Death to the instance of E21 Person that died

An instance of E69 Death may involve multiple people, for example in the case of a battle or disaster.

This is not intended for use with general natural history material, only people.

Examples:
- Mozart's death (E69) was death of Mozart (E21). (Sitwell, 2017)

This property generalises relationships like whole-part, sequence, prerequisite or inspired by between instances of E29 Design or Procedure. Any instance of E29 Design or Procedure may be associated with other designs or procedures. The property is considered to be symmetrical unless otherwise indicated by P69.1 has type. The property is not transitive.

The P69.1 has type property of P69 has association with allows the nature of the association to be specified reading from domain to range; examples of types of association between instances of E29 Design or Procedure include: has part, follows, requires, etc. 

The property can typically be used to model the decomposition of the description of a complete workflow into a series of separate procedures.
This property is transitive.

Examples:
- The procedure for glass blowing (E29) has association with the procedure for glass heating (E29). (Brooks, 1973)
- The set of instructions for performing Macbeth in Max Reinhardt's production in 1916 in Berlin at Deutsches Theater (E29) has association with the scene design drawing by Ernst Stern reproduced at http://www.glopad.org/pi/fr/record/digdoc/1003814 (E29) has type has part (E55).
- The preparation of parchment (E29) has association with soaking and unhairing of skin (E29) has type has part (E55).
- Stretching of skin (E29) has association with soaking and unhairing of skin (E29) has type follows (E55). (Poole and Reed, 1962)
- The plan for reassembling the temples at Abu Simbel (E29) has association with the plan for storing and transporting theblocks (E29) has type follows (E55). (Loubiere, 1995)

This property identifies the instance or instances E18 Physical Thing that have ceased to exist due to an instance of E81 Transformation.

The item that has ceased to exist and was replaced by the result of the Transformation. The continuity between both items, the new and the old, is expressed by the links to the common instance of E81 Transformation.

Examples:
- The transformation of the Venetian Loggia in Heraklion into a city hall (E81, E12) transformed the Venetian Loggia in Heraklion (E24). (Municipality of Heraklion, 2021)
- The mummification of Tut-Ankh-Amun (E81, E12) transformed the deceased Pharao Tut-Ankh-Amun (E21). (Carter &amp; Mace, 1977)

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This symmetric property associates two instances of E92 Spacetime Volume that have no extents in common. If only the fuzzy boundaries of the instances of E92 Spacetime Volume overlap, this property cannot be determined from observation alone and therefore should not be applied. However, there may be other forms of justification that the two instances of E92 Spacetime Volume must not have any of their extents in common regardless of where and when precisely.

If this property holds for two instances of E92 Spacetime Volume then it cannot be the case that P132 spatiotemporally overlaps with  also holds for the same two instances. Furthermore, there are cases where neither P132 spatiotemporally overlaps with nor P133 is spatiotemporally separated from holds between two instances of E92 Spacetime Volume. This would occur where only an overlap of the fuzzy boundaries of the two instances of E92 Spacetime Volume occurs and no other evidence is available.

This property is not transitive. This property is symmetric.

Examples:
- The “Hallstatt” period (E4) is spatiotemporally separated from the “La Tène” era (E4). (Marion, 2004)
- Kingdom of Greece (1831-1924) (E92) is spatiotemporally separated from Ottoman Empire (1299-1922) (E92).
- The path of the army of Alexander the Great (335-323 B.C.) (E7) is spatiotemporally separated from the Mauryan Empire (E4). (Lane Fox, 2004)

This property identifies something that is depicted by an instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing. Depicting is meant in the sense that an instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing intentionally shows, through its optical qualities or form, a representation of the entity depicted. Photographs are by default regarded as being intentional in this sense. Anything that is designed to change the properties of the depiction, such as an e-book reader, is specifically excluded. The property does not pertain to inscriptions or any other information encoding.

This property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E24 Physical Human-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item, E36 Visual Item, P138 represents to  E1 CRM Entity. P138.1 mode of depiction allows the nature of the depiction to be refined.

This property describes the active or passive participation of instances of E39 Actors in an instance of E5 Event.

It documents known events in which an instance of E39 Actor has participated during the course of that actor’s life or history. The instances of E53 Place and E52 Time-Span where and when these events happened provide us with constraints about the presence of the related instances of E39 Actor in the past. Collective actors, i.e., instances of E74 Group, may physically participate in events via their representing instances of E21 Persons only. The participation of multiple actors in an event is most likely an indication of their acquaintance and interaction.

The property implies that the actor was involved in the event but does not imply any causal relationship. For instance, someone having been portrayed can be said to have participated in the creation of the portrait.

Examples:
- Napoleon (E21) participated in The Battle of Waterloo (E7). (Dawson, 2018)
- Maria (E21) participated in Photographing of Maria (E7). (fictitious)

This property documents an instance of E36 Visual Item shown by an instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing.

This property is similar to P62 depicts (is depicted by) in that it associates an instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing with a visual representation. However, P65 shows visual item (is shown by) differs from the P62 depicts (is depicted by) property in that it makes no claims about what the instance of E36 Visual Item is deemed to represent. An instance of E36 Visual Item identifies a recognisable image or visual symbol, regardless of what this image may or may not represent.

For example, all recent British coins bear a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, a fact that is correctly documented using P62 depicts (is depicted by). Different portraits have been used at different periods, however. 

P65 shows visual item (is shown by) may also be used for Visual Items such as signs, marks and symbols, for example the 'Maltese Cross' or the 'copyright symbol’ that have no particular representational content. 

This property is part of the fully developed path E24 Physical Human-Made Thing , P65 shows visual item, E36 Visual Item, P138 represents to E1 CRM Entity which is shortcut by, P62 depicts (is depicted by).

This property describes the active or passive presence of an E77 Persistent Item in an instance of E5 Event without implying any specific role.

It documents known events in which an instance of E77 Persistent Item was present during the course of its life or history. For example, an object may be the desk, now in a museum, on which a treaty was signed. The instance of E53 Place and the instance of E52 Time-Span where and when these events happened provide us with constraints about the presence of the related instance E77 Persistent Item in the past. Instances of E90 Symbolic Object, in particular information objects, are physically present in events via at least one of the instances of E18 Physical Thing carrying them. Note, that the human mind can be such a carrier. A precondition for a transfer of information to a person or another new physical carrier is the presence of the respective information object and this person or physical thing in one event.

- Deckchair 42 (E19) was present at the sinking of the Titanic (E5). (Aldridge, 2008)

P138.1 mode of representation allows the nature of the representation to be refined.

This property is also used for the relationship between an original and a digitisation of the original by the use of techniques such as digital photography, flatbed or infrared scanning.

This property identifies the instance(s) of E39 Actor who surrender custody of an instance of E18 Physical Thing in an instance of E10 Transfer of Custody.

The property will typically describe an Actor surrendering custody of an object when it is handed over to someone else’s care. On occasion, physical custody may be surrendered involuntarily – through accident, loss or theft.
In reality, custody is either transferred to someone or from someone, or both.

Examples:
- The Secure Deliveries Inc. crew (E74) surrendered custody through The delivery of the paintings by Secure Deliveries Inc. to the National Gallery (E10).

The distinction with P50 has current keeper (is current keeper of) is that P49 has former or current keeper (is former or current keeper of) leaves open the question as to whether the specified keepers are current.

This property is a shortcut for the more detailed path from E18 Physical Thing through P30i custody transferred through, E10 Transfer of Custody, P28 custody surrendered by or P29 custody received by to E39 Actor.

Examples:
- The paintings from The Iveagh Bequest (E78) has former or current keeper Secure Deliveries Inc. (E74).

This property allows sub typing of CIDOC CRM entities -a form of specialisation – through the use of a terminological hierarchy, or thesaurus.

The CIDOC CRM is intended to focus on the high-level entities and relationships needed to describe data structures. Consequently, it does not specialise entities any further than is required for this immediate purpose. However, entities in the isA hierarchy of the CIDOC CRM may by specialised into any number of sub entities, which can be defined in the E55 Type hierarchy. E41 Appellation, for example, may be specialised into “e-mail address”, “telephone number”, “post office box”, “URL” etc. none of which figures explicitly in the CIDOC CRM hierarchy. A comprehensive explanation about refining CIDOC CRM concepts by E55 Type is given in the section “About Types” in the section on “Specific Modelling Constructs” of this document.

This property is a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through P41i was classified by, E17 Type Assignment, P42 assigned to E55 Type.

This property describes the use of material or immaterial things in a way essential to the performance or the outcome of an instance of E7 Activity.

This property typically applies to tools, instruments, moulds, raw materials and items embedded in a product. It implies that the presence of the object in question was a necessary condition for the action. For example, the activity of writing this text required the use of a computer. An immaterial thing can be used if at least one of its carriers is present. For example, the software tools on a computer.

Another example is the use of a particular name by a particular group of people over some span to identify a thing, such as a settlement. In this case, the physical carriers of this name are at least the people understanding its use.

Examples:
- The writing of this scope note of the CIDOC CRM property “P16 used specific object” contained in the CIDOC CRM version 4.1 (E7) used specific object Nicholas Crofts’ computer (E22) mode of use Typing Tool; Storage Medium (E55). [the original scope note was later extended in the CIDOC CRM version 4.3]

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This property associates an instance of E41 Appellation with another instance of E41 Appellation that constitutes a derivative or variant of the former and that may also be used for identifying items identified by the former, in suitable contexts, independent from the particular item to be identified. This property should not be confused with additional variants of names used characteristically for a single, particular item, such as individual nicknames. It is an asymmetric relationship, where the range expresses the derivative, if such a direction can be established. Otherwise, the relationship is symmetric. The relationship is not transitive.

Multiple names assigned to an object, which do not apply to all things identified with the specific instance of E41 Appellation, should be modelled as repeated values of P1 is identified by (identifies) of this object.

P139.1 has type allows the type of derivation to be refined, for instance “transliteration from Latin 1 to ASCII”. 

Examples:
- "Martin Doerr" (E41) has alternative form "Martin Dörr" (E41) has type Alternate spelling (E55).
- "Гончарова, Наталья Сергеевна" (E41) has alternative form "Gončarova, Natal´â Sergeevna" (E41) has type ISO 9:1995 transliteration (E55).
- “Αθήνα” (E41) has alternative form “Athina” (E41) has type transcription (E55).

In First Order Logic:
P139(x,y) ⊃ E41(x)
P139(x,y) ⊃ E41(y)

This symmetric property associates an instance of E53 Place with another instance of E53 Place which shares a part of its border. 

This property is purely spatial. It does not imply that the phenomena that define, by their extent, places related by P122 borders with have ever shared a respective border at the same time or even coexisted. In particular, this may be the case when the respective common border is formed by a natural feature. 

This property is not transitive. This property is symmetric.

This property describes the naming or identification of any real-world item by a name or any other identifier.

This property is intended for identifiers in general use, which form part of the world the model intends to describe, and not merely for internal database identifiers which are specific to a technical system, unless these latter also have a more general use outside the technical context. This property includes in particular identification by mathematical expressions such as coordinate systems used for the identification of instances of E53 Place. The property does not reveal anything about when, where and by whom this identifier was used. A more detailed representation can be made using the fully developed (i.e., indirect) path through E15 Identifier Assignment.

This is a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through ‘P140i was attributed by’, E15 Identifier Assignment, P37 assigned to E42 Identifier.

It is also a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through P1 is identified by, E41 Appellation, P139 has alternative form to E41 Appellation.

Examples:
- The capital of Italy (E53) is identified by "Rome" (E41). (Leach, 2017)

This property identifies an instance E90 Symbolic Object carried by an instance of E18 Physical Thing. Since an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is defined as an immaterial idealization over potentially multiple carriers, any individual realization on a particular physical carrier may be defective, due to deterioration or shortcomings in the process of creating the realization compared to the intended ideal. As long as such defects do not substantially affect the complete recognition of the respective symbolic object, it is still regarded as carrying an instance of this E90 Symbolic Object. If these defects are of scholarly interest, the particular realization can be modelled as an instance of E25 Human-Made Feature. Note, that any instance of E90 Symbolic Object incorporated (P165) in the carried symbolic object is also carried by the same instance of E18 Physical Thing.

Examples:
- Matthew’s paperback copy of Reach for the Sky (E18) carries the text of Reach for the Sky (E73). [see also: (Brickhill, 2001)] (fictitious)

This property identifies the instance of E74 Group of which an instance of E39 Actor becomes a member through an instance of E85 Joining.

Although a joining activity normally concerns only one instance of E74 Group, it is possible to imagine circumstances under which becoming member of one Group implies becoming member of another Group as well.

Joining events allow for describing people becoming members of a group with a more detailed path from E74 Group through, P144i gained member by, E85 Joining, P143 joined, E39 Actor, compared to the shortcut offered by P107 has current or former member (is current or former member of).
The property P144.1 kind of member can be used to specify the type of membership or the role the member has in the group. 

Examples:
- The election of Sir Isaac Newton as Member of Parliament to the Convention Parliament of 1689 (E85) joined with the Convention Parliament (E74). (Iliffe, 2013)
- The inauguration of Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev as Leader of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1985 (E85) joined with the office of Leader of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) (E74) kind of member President (E55). (Galeotti, 1997)

This property links an instance of E6 Destruction to an instance of E18 Physical Thing that has been destroyed by it.

Destruction implies the end of an item’s life as a subject of cultural documentation – the physical matter of which the item was composed may in fact continue to exist. An instance of E6 Destruction may be contiguous with an instance of E12 Production that brings into existence a derived object composed partly of matter from the destroyed object.

Examples:
- the Tay Bridge Desaster (E6) destroyed The Tay Bridge (E22). (Thomas, 1972)

This symmetric property associates an instance of E53 Place with another instance of E53 Place geometrically overlapping it.

It does not specify anything about the shared area. This property is purely spatial. It does not imply that phenomena that define, by their extent, places related by P121 overlaps with have ever covered a common area at the same time or even coexisted. In contrast, spatiotemporal overlaps described by P132 spatiotemporally overlaps are the total of areas simultaneously covered by the related spacetime volumes.

This property is symmetric.

Examples:
- The territory of the United States as in 2020 (E53) overlaps with the Arctic (E53). (Gannett et al., 1904)
- The maximal extent of the Kingdom of Greece (1832-1973) (E53) overlaps with the maximal extent of the Republic of Turkey (29th October 1923 to now) (E53).

This property identifies a specific instance of E29 Design or Procedure in order to carry out an instance of E7 Activity or parts of it.

The property differs from P32 used general technique (was technique of) in that P33 refers to an instance of E29 Design or Procedure, which is a concrete information object in its own right rather than simply being a term or a method known by tradition.

Typical examples would include intervention plans for conservation or the construction plans of a building

Examples:
- The Ornamentation of silver cup 232 (E11) used specific technique 'Instructions for golden chase work by A N Other' (E29). (fictitious)
- The rebuilding ofthe German Reichstag in Berlin (E11) used specific technique Architectural plans by Foster and Partners (E29). (Foster, 2000)

This property associates an instance of E70 Thing with an instance of E55 Type describing its general usage.

It allows the relationship between particular things, both physical and immaterial, and the general methods and techniques of real use to be documented. This may well be different from the intended functional purpose of the instance of E70 Thing (which can be documented with P103 was intended for (was intention of)). For example, it could be recorded that a particular wooden crate had a general use as a shelf support on a market stall even though it had been originally intended for carrying vegetables.

The use of this property is intended to allow the documentation of usage patterns attested in historical records or through scientific investigation (for instance ceramic residue analysis). It should not be used to document the intended, and thus assumed, use of an object.

Examples:
- Tony Gill’s Ford Mustang (E22) had as general use transportation (E55).

This property records the dimension that was observed in an E16 Measurement Event.

E54 Dimension can be any quantifiable aspect of E70 Thing. Weight, image colour depth and monetary value are dimensions in this sense. One measurement activity may determine more than one dimension of one object.

Dimensions may be determined either by direct observation or using recorded evidence. In the latter case the measured Thing does not need to be present or extant.

Even though knowledge of the value of a dimension requires measurement, the dimension may be an object of discourse prior to, or even without, any measurement being made.

This property identifies the instance E24 Physical Human-Made Thing that was diminished by an instance of E80 Part Removal.

Although an instance of E80 Part removal activity normally concerns only one instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing, it is possible to imagine circumstances under which more than one item might be diminished by a single instance of E80 Part Removal activity.

- The coffin of Tut-Ankh-Amun (E22) was diminished by The opening of the coffin of Tut-Ankh-Amun (E80). (Carter, 2014)

    >Scope note:
This property describes the largest volume in space, an instance of E53 Place, that an instance of E18 Physical Thing has occupied at any time during its existence, with respect to the reference space relative to the physical thing itself. This allows for describing the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. The reference space for the associated place must be the one that is permanently at rest (P157 is at rest relative to) relative to the physical thing. For instances of E19 Physical Objects it is the one which is at rest relative to the object itself, i.e., which moves together with the object. For instances of E26 Physical Feature it is one which is at rest relative to the physical feature itself and the surrounding matter immediately connected to it. Therefore, there is a 1:1 relation between the instance E18 Physical Thing and the instance of E53 Place it occupies. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces.

This property implies the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place. However, in contrast to P156 occupies, the property P161 has spatial projection does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place.

In contrast to P156 occupies, for the property P53 has former or current location the following holds:
- It does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place.
- It identifies a possibly wider instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time span.
- If the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place is not at rest with respect to the physical thing found there, the physical thing may move away after some time to another place and/or may have been at some other place before. The same holds for the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place. 

Examples:
- The Saint Titus reliquary (E22) occupies the space of the Saint Titus reliquary (E53). [The reliquary is currently kept in the Saint Titus Church in Heraklion, Crete since 1966 and contains the skull of Saint Titus.] (Fisher &amp; Garvey, 2010)
- Burg Eltz near Koblenz, Germany (E24) occupies the space within the 1661AD outer walls of Burg Eltz (E53). [The castle (English name: Eltz Castle) underwent a series of expansions starting in the 12th century until it reached its current extent in 1661AD and contains buildings from various periods.]

This property describes the spatial location of an instance of E4 Period.

The related instance of E53 Place should be seen as a wider approximation of the geometric area within which the phenomena that characterise the period in question occurred, see below. P7 took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (frequently on the surface of the earth). For example, the period “Révolution française” can be said to have taken place in “France in 1789”; the “Victorian” period may be said to have taken place in “Britain from 1837- 1901” and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and North America. An instance of E4 Period can take place at multiple non-contiguous, non-overlapping locations.

This property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within to E53 Place. E4 Period is a subclass of E92 Spacetime Volume. By the definition of P161 has spatial projection an instance of E4 Period takes place on all its spatial projections, that is, instances of E53 Place. Something happening at a given place can also be considered to happen at a larger place containing the first. For example, the assault on the Bastille July 14th 1789 took place in the area covered by Paris in 1789 but also in the area covered by France in 1789. 

Examples 
- the period “Révolution française” (E4) took place at the area covered by France in 1789 (E53). (Bertaud, 2004)

    >Scope note: 
This property associates an instance of E18 Physical Thing with the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume that constitutes the complete trajectory of its geometric extent through spacetime for the whole time of the existence of the instance of E18 Physical Thing.

An instance of E18 Physical Thing not only occupies a particular geometric space at each instant of its existence, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime, i.e., the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume this property associates it with. This real spatiotemporal extent of the instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded as being unique, in all its details and fuzziness; the identity and existence of the E92 Spacetime Volume depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing, whose existence defines it. It constitutes a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013).

Included in this spacetime volume are both the spaces filled by the matter of the physical thing and any inner space that may exist, for instance the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a finite number of individually contiguous subsets of this spacetime volume equal to the number of objects that constitute the set and that are never connected during its existence.

Examples:
- H.M.S. Temeraire (E22) defines the spacetime volume of H.M.S. Temeraire (E92). [it was built, during 1798, in Chatham and destroyed, during 1838, in Rotherhithe] (Willis, 2010)
- The Saint Titus reliquary (E22) defines the Spacetime Volume of the Saint Titus reliquary (E92). [the reliquary has been produced by the workshop of the Vogiatzis brothers located at Monastiraki, Athens, in 1966 as container for the skull of Saint Titus, which was placed into it at that time and has since then continued to fall within the container's spacetime volume. The reliquary with the skull has been kept in the Saint Titus Church in Heraklion, Crete since 1966] (Fisher &amp; Garvey, 2010) (Panotis, 2016)

This property associates an instance of E90 Symbolic Object with a complete, identifying representation of its content in the form of an instance of E62 String.

This property only applies to instances of E90 Symbolic Object that can be represented completely in this form. The representation may be more specific than the symbolic level defining the identity condition of the represented. This depends on the type of the symbolic object represented. For instance, if a name has type "Modern Greek character sequence", it may be represented in a loss-free Latin transcription, meaning however the sequence of Greek letters.

As another example, if the represented object has type "English words sequence", American English or British English spelling variants may be chosen to represent the English word "colour" without defining a different symbolic object. If a name has type "European traditional name", no particular string may define its content.

Examples:
- The materials description of the painting (E33) has symbolic content “Oil, French Watercolors on Paper, Graphite and Ink on Canvas, with an Oak frame.” (E62).
- The title of Einstein’s 1915 text (E35) has symbolic content “Relativity, the Special and the General Theory” (E62). (Einstein, 2001)
- The story of Little Red Riding Hood (E33) has symbolic content “Once upon a time there lived in a certain village.” (E62). (Lang, 1965)

Since instances of E53 Places may not have precisely known spatial extents, the CIDOC CRM supports statements about maximum spatial extents of instances of E53 Place. This property allows an instance of E53 Place’s maximum spatial extent (i.e., its outer boundary) to be assigned an instance of E94 Space Primitive value. 

This property is a shortcut of the fully developed path from E53 Place, P89 falls within, E53 Place, P168 place is defined by to E94 Space Primitive through a declarative Place that is not explicitly documented, to a Space Primitive: declarative places are defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013).

Examples:	
- The spatial extent of the Acropolis of Athens (E53) at some place within POLYGON ((37.969172 23.720787, 37.973122 23.721495 37.972741 23.728994, 37.969299 23.729735, 37.969172 23.720787)) (E94).

This property associates an instance of E52 Time-Span with an instance of E61 Time Primitive specifying a minimum period of time covered by it. Since Time-Spans may not have precisely known temporal extents, the CIDOC CRM supports statements about the minimum and maximum temporal extents of Time-Spans. This property allows a Time-Span’s minimum temporal extent (i.e., its inner boundary) to be assigned an E61 Time Primitive value. Time Primitives are treated by the CIDOC CRM as application or system specific date intervals, and are not further analysed. If different sources of evidence justify different minimum extents without contradicting each other, the smallest interval including all these extents will be the best estimate. This should be taken into account for information integration.

Examples:
- The time-span of the development of the CIDOC CRM (E52) ongoing throughout “1996-2003” (E61). (Doerr, 2003)
- The Time-Span of the Thirty Years War (E52) ongoing throughout “23rd May 1618 AD until 24th October 1648 AD” (E61). (Bonney, 2014)
- The time-span of the First Intermediate Period of Ancient Egypt (7th to 10th dynasty) (E52) ongoing throughout “2181 BC – 2160 BC” (E61). (Reid, 1993)
[This is the minimal common agreement of two conflicting dates: James Henry Breasted dates the First Intermediate Period of Ancient Egypt (7th to 10th dynasty) from 2475BC to 2160BC in his Ancient Records (first published in 1906), volume 1, sections 58–75 (Breasted, 1906). Ian Shaw dates it from 2181BC to 2125BC in his Oxford History of Ancient Egypt (published in 2000), pp. 479–483 (Shaw, 2000).]

This property associates an instance of E53 Place with an instance of E94 Space Primitive that defines it. Syntactic variants or use of different scripts may result in multiple instances of E94 Space Primitive defining exactly the same place. Transformations between different reference systems always result in new definitions of places approximating each other and not in alternative definitions.

Examples:
- The centroid from https://sws.geonames.org/735927 (E53) place is defined by 40°31'17.9"N 21°15'48.3"E (E94). [A single point for approximating the centre of the city of Kastoria, Greece]
- Martin’s coordinates for Kastoria (E53) place is defined by 40°30'23"N 21°14'53"E, 40°31'40"N 21°16'43"E (E94). [A square covering the built settlement structure of Kastoria, Greece]
- Martin’s centroid for Kastoria (E53) place is defined by 40°31'01.5"N 21°15'48"E (E94). [A point in the lake of Kastoria in the centre of the area covered by the city]
- The position measured by Alexander von Humboldt for the Plaza Mayor in Cumaná, Sucre, Venezuela 1799-1800AD (E53) place is defined by 10°27'52"N 66°30'02"W (E94). [West of the Observatory of Paris = 64°09'51"W of Greenwich, actually 1,1km east of today’s Plaza Andrés Eloy Blanco of Cumaná] (Humboldt, 1859)

This property is a container for all informal descriptions about an object that have not been expressed in terms of CIDOC CRM constructs.

In particular, it captures the characterisation of the item itself, its internal structures, appearance etc.

Like property P2 has type (is type of), this property is a consequence of the restricted focus of the CIDOC CRM. The aim is not to capture, in a structured form, everything that can be said about an item; indeed, the CIDCO CRM formalism is not regarded as sufficient to express everything that can be said. Good practice requires use of distinct note fields for different aspects of a characterisation. The P3.1 has type property of P3 has note allows differentiation of specific notes, e.g., "construction", "decoration" etc.

An item may have many notes, but a note is attached to a specific item.

Examples:
- coffee mug - OXCMS:1983.1.1 (E19) has note "chipped at edge of handle" (E62) has type Condition (E55). (fictitious)

This property associates an instance of E18 Physical Thing with another instance of Physical Thing that forms part of it. The spatial extent of the composing part is included in the spatial extent of the whole.

Component elements, since they are themselves instances of E18 Physical Thing, may be further analysed into sub-components, thereby creating a hierarchy of part decomposition. An instance of E18 Physical Thing may be shared between multiple wholes, for example two buildings may share a common wall. This property does not specify when and for how long a component element resided in the respective whole. If a component is not part of a whole from the beginning of existence or until the end of existence of the whole, the classes E79 Part Addition and E90 Part Removal can be used to document when a component became part of a particular whole and/or when it stopped being a part of it. For the time-span of being part of the respective whole, the component is completely contained in the place the whole occupies.

This property is intended to describe specific components that are individually documented, rather than general aspects. Overall descriptions of the structure of an instance of E18 Physical Thing are captured by the P3 has note property.

The instances of E57 Material of which an instance of E18 Physical Thing is composed should be documented using P45 consists of (is incorporated in).

This property describes the decomposition of an instance of E3 Condition State into discrete, subsidiary states.

It is assumed that the sub-states into which the condition state is analysed form a logical whole - although the entire story may not be completely known – and that the sub-states are in fact constitutive of the general condition state.
