            >This property describes the naming or identification of any real world item by a name or any other identifier. 

This property is intended for identifiers in general use, which form part of the world the model intends to describe, and not merely for internal database identifiers which are specific to a technical system, unless these latter also have a more general use outside the technical context. This property includes in particular identification by mathematical expressions such as coordinate systems used for the identification of instances of E53 Place. The property does not reveal anything about when, where and by whom this identifier was used. A more detailed representation can be made using the fully developed (i.e. indirect) path through E15 Identifier Assignment.
Examples: the capital of Italy (E53) is identified by &quot;Rome&quot; (E48), text 25014-32 (E33) is identified by &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (E35).</rdfs:comment>

This property describes the use of material or immaterial things in a way essential to the
performance or the outcome of an E7 Activity.
This property typically applies to tools, instruments, moulds, raw materials and items
embedded in a product. It implies that the presence of the object in question was a necessary
condition for the action. For example, the activity of writing this text required the use of a
computer. An immaterial thing can be used if at least one of its carriers is present. For
example, the software tools on a computer.
Another example is the use of a particular name by a particular group of people over some
span to identify a thing, such as a settlement. In this case, the physical carriers of this name are
at least the people understanding its use.
Examples:
- the writing of this scope note (E7) used specific object Nicholas Crofts&#8217; computer (E22)

In particular it captures the characterisation of the item itself, its internal structures, appearance etc.
Like property P2 has type (is type of), this property is a consequence of the restricted focus of the CRM. The aim is not to capture, in a structured form, everything that can be said about an item; indeed, the CRM formalism is not regarded as sufficient to express everything that can be said. Good practice requires use of distinct note fields for different aspects of a characterisation. The P3.1 has type property of P3 has note allows differentiation of specific notes, e.g. &quot;construction&quot;, &quot;decoration&quot; etc. 
An item may have many notes, but a note is attached to a specific item.

This property is similar to P62 depicts (is depicted by) in that it associates an item of E24 Physical Man-Made Thing with a visual representation. However, P65 shows visual item (is shown by) differs from the P62 depicts (is depicted by) property in that it makes no claims about what the E36 Visual Item is deemed to represent. E36 Visual Item identifies a recognisable image or visual symbol, regardless of what this image may or may not represent.

For example, all recent British coins bear a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, a fact that is correctly documented using P62 depicts (is depicted by). Different portraits have been used at different periods, however. P65 shows visual item (is shown by) can be used to refer to a particular portrait.
P65 shows visual item (is shown by) may also be used for Visual Items such as signs, marks and symbols, for example the &#39;Maltese Cross&#39; or the &#39;copyright symbol&#39; that have no particular representational content.

This property is in effect a special case of P7 took place at. It describes a period that can be located with respect to the space defined by an E19 Physical Object such as a ship or a building.

This property allows a Time-Span&#39;s minimum temporal extent (i.e. it&#39;s inner boundary) to be assigned an E61 Time Primitive value. Time Primitives are treated by the CRM as application or system specific date intervals, and are not further analysed.

3. Attachment of free text for the expression of anything not captured by formal properties

            >This class comprises transfers of physical custody of objects between instances of E39 Actor.

The recording of the donor and/or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E10
Transfer of Custody there is either no donor or no recipient. Depending on the circumstances it
may describe:
1. the beginning of custody
2. the end of custody
3. the transfer of custody
4. the receipt of custody from an unknown source
5. the declared loss of an object

The distinction between the legal responsibility for custody and the actual physical possession of the object should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). A specific case of transfer of custody is theft.

The interpretation of the museum notion of &quot;accession&quot; differs between institutions. The CRM therefore models legal ownership and physical custody separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.

Examples: the delivery of the paintings by Secure Deliveries Inc. to the National Gallery; the return of Picasso&#8217;s &quot;Guernica&quot; to Madrid&#8217;s Prado in 1981.</rdfs:comment>

            >This class comprises all instances of E7 Activity that create, alter or change E24 Physical Man-Made Thing.

This class includes the production of an item from raw materials, and other so far undocumented objects, and the preventive treatment or restoration of an object for conservation.

Since the distinction between modification and production is not always clear, modification is regarded as the more generally applicable concept. This implies that some items may be consumed or destroyed in a Modification, and that others may be produced as a result of it. An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities. 

If the instance of the E29 Design or Procedure utilised for the modification prescribes the use of specific materials, they should be documented using properties of the design or procedure, rather than via P126 employed (was employed in): E57 Material.

Examples: the construction of the SS Great Britain (E12); the impregnation of the Vasa warship in Stockholm for preservation after 1956; the transformation of the Enola Gay into a museum exhibit by the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC between 1993 and 1995 (E12, E81); the last renewal of the gold coating of the Toshogu shrine in Nikko, Japan.</rdfs:comment>

            >This class comprises activities that are designed to, and succeed in, creating one or more new items.

It specializes the notion of modification into production. The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered &quot;new&quot; if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered &quot;new&quot; because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one.

This entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event.

An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.

Examples: the construction of the SS Great Britain; the recasting of the Little Mermaid at the harbour of Copenhagen; the seventh edition of Rembrandt&#8217;s etching &quot;Woman sitting half dressed beside a stove&quot;,
1658, Bartsch Number 197.</rdfs:comment>

            >This class comprises the actions of making assertions about properties of an object or any relation between two items or concepts.

This class allows the documentation of how the respective assignment came about, and whose opinion it was. All the attributes or properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly attached to the respective item or concept, possibly as a collection of contradictory values. All cases of properties in this model that are also described indirectly through an action are characterised as &quot;short cuts&quot; of this action. This redundant modelling of two alternative views is preferred because many implementations may have good reasons to model either the action or the short cut, and the relation between both alternatives can be captured by simple rules.

In particular, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain museum procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on if this information should be accessible by structured queries.

Example: the assessment of the current ownership of Martin Doerr&#8217;s silver cup in February 1997.</rdfs:comment>

            >This class comprises activities that result in the allocation of an identifier to an instance of E1 CRM Entity. An E15 Identifier Assignment may include the creation of the identifier from multiple constituents, which themselves may be instances of E41 Appellation. The syntax and kinds of constituents to be used may be declared in a rule constituting an instance of E29 Design or Procedure.

Examples of such identifiers include Find Numbers, Inventory Numbers, uniform titles in the sense of librarianship and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). Documenting the act of identifier assignment and deassignment is especially useful when objects change custody or the identification system of an organization is changed. In order to keep track of the identity of things in such cases, it is important to document by whom, when and for what purpose an identifier is assigned to an item.

The fact that an identifier is a preferred one for an organisation can be expressed by using the property E1 CRM Entity. P48 has preferred identifier (is preferred identifier of): E42 Identifier. It can better be expressed in a context independent form by assigning a suitable E55 Type, such as &quot;preferred identifier assignment&quot;, to the respective instance of E15 Identifier Assignment via the P2 has type property.

Examples: replacement of the inventory number TA959a by GE34604 for a 17th century lament cloth
at the Museum Benaki, Athens; 
Assigning the author-uniform title heading &quot;Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, 1749-1832.Faust. 1. Theil.&quot; for a work (E28);

Examples include measuring the monetary value of a collection of coins or the running time of a specific video cassette.

The E16 Measurement may use simple counting or tools, such as yardsticks or radiation detection devices. The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage. Details of methods and devices are best handled as free text, whereas basic techniques such as &quot;carbon 14 dating&quot; should be encoded using P2 has type (is type of:) E55 Type.
      
Examples: measurement of height of silver cup 232 on the 31st August 1997; the carbon 14 dating of the &quot;Schoeninger Speer II&quot; in 1996 [an about 400.000 years old Palaeolithic complete wooden spear found in Schoeningen, Niedersachsen, Germany in 1995].</rdfs:comment>

The class also includes all aggregates of objects made for functional purposes of whatever kind, independent of physical coherence, such as a set of chessman. Typically instances of this class could be moved (if not too heavy). 
In some contexts such objects, except for aggregates, are also called &quot;bona fide objects&quot; (Smith &amp; Warzi, 2000, pp.401-420), i.e. naturally defined objects. 
The decision as to what is documented as a complete item, rather than by its parts or components, may be purely administrative or may be a result of the order in which the item was acquired.

In some contexts, these are also called perdurants. This class is disjoint from E77 Persistent Item. This is an abstract class and has no direct instances. E2 Temporal Entity is specialized into E4 Period, which applies to a particular geographic area (defined with a greater or lesser degree of precision), and E3 Condition State, which applies to instances of E18 Physical Thing.

            >This class comprises identifiable features that are physically attached in an integral way to particular physical objects.
Instances of E26 Physical Feature share many of the attributes of instances of E19 Physical Object. They may have a one-, two- or three-dimensional geometric extent, but there are no natural borders that separate them completely in an objective way from the carrier objects. For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not.
Instances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colours, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature.

This definition coincides with the definition of the &quot;fiat objects&quot; (B. Smith &amp; Varzi, 2000, pp.401-420), with the exception of aggregates of &quot;bona fide objects&quot;. 

Examples: The temple in Abu Simbel before its removal, Albrecht Duerer&#39;s signature on his painting of Charles the Great, the damage to the nose of the Great Sphinx in Giza, Michael Jackson&#39;s nose prior to plastic surgery.</rdfs:comment>

This class does not intend to describe the idiosyncratic characteristics of an individual physical embodiment of a visual item, but the underlying prototype. For example, a mark such as the ICOM logo is generally considered to be the same logo when used on any number of publications. The size, orientation and colour may change, but the logo remains uniquely identifiable. The same is true of images that are reproduced many times. This means that visual items are independent of their physical support.

The class E36 Visual Item provides a means of identifying and linking together instances of E24 Physical Man-Made Thing that carry the same visual symbols, marks or images etc. The property P62 depicts (is depicted by) between E24 Physical Man-Made Thing and depicted subjects (E1 CRM Entity) can be regarded as a short-cut of the more fully developed path from E24 Physical Man-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item, P138 represents (has representation) to E1CRM Entity, which in addition captures the optical features of the depiction.

The images in a &quot;spot the difference&quot; competition are not the same with respect to their context, however similar they may be at first appear. 

Examples: The front side of all 20 Frs notes, the image depicted on all reproductions of the Mona Lisa.</rdfs:comment>

            >This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations bounded in time and space.

It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatio-temporal bounds. These bounds are a mere approximation of the actual process of growth, spread and retreat. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area as a sedentary culture.

Typically this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the &quot;Neolithic Period&quot;, the &quot;Ming Dynasty&quot; or the &quot;McCarthy Era&quot;. There are however no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.

There are two different conceptualisations of &#39;artistic style&#39;, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, &quot;Impressionism&quot; can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.

Another specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.

Examples: Jurassic, European Bronze Age, Italian Renaissance, Thirty Years War, Sturm und Drang, Cubism.</rdfs:comment>

Instances of E41 Appellation do not identify things by their meaning, even if they happen to have one, but by convention, tradition, or agreement. Instances of E41 Appellation are cultural constructs; as such, they have a context, a history, and a use in time and space by some group of users. A given instance of E41 Appellation can have alternative forms, i.e., other instances of E41 Appellation that are always regarded as equivalent independent from the thing it denotes. 

Specific subclasses of E41 Appellation should be used when instances of E41 Appellation of a characteristic form are used for particular objects. Instances of E49 Time Appellation, for example, which take the form of instances of E50 Date, can be easily recognised.

E41 Appellation should not be confused with the act of naming something. Cf. E15 Identifier Assignment

The distinction between an E5 Event and an E4 Period is partly a question of the scale of observation. Viewed at a coarse level of detail, an E5 Event is an &#39;instantaneous&#39; change of state. At a fine level, the E5 Event can be analysed into its component phenomena within a space and time frame, and as such can be seen as an E4 Period. The reverse is not necessarily the case: not all instances of E4 Period give rise to a noteworthy change of state.

Time Span has no other semantic connotations. Time-Spans are used to define the temporal extent of instances of E4 Period, E5 Event and any other phenomena valid for a certain time. An E52 Time-Span may be identified by one or more instances of E49 Time Appellation.

Since our knowledge of history is imperfect, instances of E52 Time-Span can best be considered as approximations of the actual Time-Spans of temporal entities. The properties of E52 Time-Span are intended to allow these approximations to be expressed precisely. An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. Used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it would nevertheless define them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else was known. Automatic processing and querying of instances of E52 Time-Span is facilitated if data can be parsed into an E61 Time Primitive.

Examples: 1961, from 12-17-1993 to 12-8-1996, 14h30 - 16h22 4th July 1945, 9.30 am 1.1.1999 to 2.00 pm 1.1.1999, duration of the Ming Dynasty.</rdfs:comment>

The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of &quot;immobile&quot; objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.

It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise.
In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object &#8211; H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.
Any object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a &quot;section&quot; of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination.

Examples: the extent of the UK in the year 2003; the position of the hallmark on the inside of my wedding ring; the place referred to in the phrase: &quot;Fish collected at three miles north of the confluence of the Arve and the Rhone&quot;; Here -&amp;gt; &amp;lt;-</rdfs:comment>

            >This class comprises quantifiable properties that can be measured by some calibrated means
and can be approximated by values, i.e. points or regions in a mathematical or conceptual
space, such as natural or real numbers, RGB values etc.
An instance of E54 Dimension represents the true quantity, independent from its numerical
approximation, e.g. in inches or in cm. The properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for
expressing the numerical approximation of the values of an instance of E54 Dimension. If the
true values belong to a non-discrete space, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to
record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed
true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the
precision of the respective observation. Note, that interoperability of values described in
different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.
Numerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical
records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be
recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension as appropriate.
Examples:
-the height of silver cup 232
-The RGB value matrix of my digital image IMG_0025 from 4-5-2007
- the wingspan of my stuffed chaffinch &#8216;Fringilla coelebs Linnaeus, 1758&#8217;

            >This class comprises events that destroy one or more instances of E18 Physical Thing such that they lose their identity as the subjects of documentation.

Some destruction events are intentional, while others are independent of human activity. Intentional destruction may be documented by classifying the event as both an E6 Destruction and E7 Activity.

The decision to document an object as destroyed, transformed or modified is context sensitive:
1. If the matter remaining from the destruction is not documented, the event is modelled solely as E6                        Destruction.
2. An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or              more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the original. In this            case, the new items have separate identities. Matter is preserved, but identity is not.
3. When the initial identity of the changed instance of E18 Physical Thing is preserved, the event should be              documented as E11 Modification.

Examples: the destruction of Lisbon by earthquake in 1755; the destruction of Nineveh (E6, E7); the breaking of a champagne glass yesterday by my dog; the shooting of the last wolf (&#39;Canis lupus Linne, 1758&#39;) of the Rhineland/Germany, in Birreskopf/Eifel 1860 (now Museum Alexander Koenig inventory no.: ZFMK 86.385) (E6, E7).</rdfs:comment>

E67 Birth is a biological event focussing on the context of people coming into life. (E63 Beginning of Existence comprises the coming into life of any living beings).

Twins, triplets etc. are brought into life by the same E67 Birth event. The introduction of the E67 Birth event as a documentation element allows the description of a range of family relationships in a simple model. Suitable extensions may describe more details and the complexity of motherhood with the intervention of modern medicine.

A gathering of people becomes an E74 Group when it exhibits organizational characteristics usually typified by a set of ideas or beliefs held in common, or actions performed together. These might be communication, creating some common artifact, a common purpose such as study, worship, business, sports, etc. Nationality can be modeled as membership in an E74 Group (cf. HumanML markup). Married couples and other concepts of family are regarded as particular examples of E74 Group.

            >This class comprises items that have a persistent identity, sometimes known as &quot;endurants&quot; in philosophy.

They can be repeatedly recognized within the duration of their existence by identity criteria rather than by continuity or observation. Persistent Items can be either physical entities, such as people, animals or things, or conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or common names.

The criteria that determine the identity of an item are often difficult to establish -; the decision depends largely on the judgement of the observer. For example, a building is regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria.
Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. The class E77 Persistent Item does not take any position about the nature of the applicable identity criteria and if actual knowledge about identity of an instance of this class exists. There may be cases, where the identity of an E77 Persistent Item is not decidable by a certain state of knowledge. The main classes of objects that fall outside the scope the E77 Persistent Item class are
temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties.

Examples are: Leonardo da Vinci, Stonehenge, the hole in the ozone layer. the First Law of Thermodynamics, the Bermuda Triangle.</rdfs:comment>

            >This class comprises activities that result in an instance of E24 Physical Man-Made Thing being increased, enlarged or augmented by the addition of a part.

Typical scenarios include the attachment of an accessory, the integration of a component, the addition of an element to an aggregate object, or the accessioning of an object into a curated E78 Collection. Objects to which parts are added are, by definition, man-made, since the addition of a part implies a human activity. Following the addition of parts, the resulting man-made assemblages are treated objectively as single identifiable wholes, made up of constituent or component parts bound together either physically (for example the engine becoming a part of the car), or by sharing a common purpose (such as the 32 chess pieces that make up a chess
set). This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history and continuity of identity of objects that are integrated into other objects over time, such as precious gemstones being repeatedly incorporated into different items of jewellery, or cultural artifacts being added to different museum instances of E78 Collection over their lifespan.

The class also applies to the establishment or loss of ownership of instances of E18 Physical Thing. It does not, however, imply changes of any other kinds of right. The recording of the donor and/or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E8 Acquisition there is either no donor or no recipient. Depending on the circumstances, it may describe:
1.   the beginning of ownership
2.   the end of ownership
3.   the transfer of ownership
4.   the acquisition from an unknown source
5.   the loss of title due to destruction of the item

It may also describe events where a collector appropriates legal title, for example by annexation or field collection. The interpretation of the museum notion of &quot;accession&quot; differs between institutions. The CRM therefore models legal ownership (E8 Acquisition) and physical custody (E10 Transfer of Custody) separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.
      
Examples: the collection of a hammer-head shark of the genus Sphyrna (Carchariniformes) by John Steinbeck and Edward Ricketts at Puerto Escondido in the Gulf of Mexico on March 25th, 1940;
the acquisition of El Greco&#8217;s &quot;The Apostles Peter and Paul&quot; by the State Hermitage in Saint Petersburg;

Typical scenarios include the detachment of an accessory, the removal of a component or part of a composite object, or the deaccessioning of an object from a curated E78 Collection. If the E80 Part Removal results in the total decomposition of the original object into pieces, such that the whole ceases to exist, the activity should instead be modelled as an E81 Transformation, i.e. a simultaneous destruction and production. In cases where the part removed has no discernible identity prior to its removal but does have an identity subsequent to its removal, the activity should be regarded as both E80 Part Removal and E12 Production.

Although the two instances of E77 Persistent Item are treated as discrete entities having separate, unique identities, they are causally connected through the E81 Transformation; the destruction of the first E77 Persistent Item directly causes the creation of the second using or preserving some relevant substance. Instances of E81 Transformation are therefore distinct from re-classifications (documented using E17 Type Assignment) or modifications (documented using E11 Modification) of objects that do not fundamentally change their nature or identity. Characteristic cases are reconstructions and repurposing of historical buildings or ruins, fires leaving buildings in ruins, taxidermy of specimen in natural history and the reorganization of a corporate body into a new one.

It is typically a rigorous scholarly or scientific process that ensures a type is exhaustively described and appropriately named.

The activity of E83 Type Creation is central to research in the life sciences, where a type would be referred to as a &quot;taxon&quot;, the type description as a &quot;protologue&quot;, and the exemplary specimens as &quot;orgininal element&quot; or &quot;holotype&quot;.

Note that any E18 Physical Thing may carry information, such as an E34 Inscription. However, unless it was specifically designed for this purpose, it is not an Information Carrier.

Items are accumulated and organized following criteria like subject, chronological period, material type, style of art etc. and can be added or removed from an E78 Collection for a specific purpose and/or audience. The initial aggregation of items of a collection is regarded as an instance of E12 Production Event while the activity of evolving, preserving and promoting a collection is regarded as an instance of E87 Curation Activity.

This class also comprises items that are &#8220;about&#8221; something in the sense of a subject. In the
wider sense, this class includes expressions of psychological value such as non-figural art and
musical themes. However, conceptual items such as types and classes are not instances of E89
Propositional Object. This should not be confused with the definition of a type, which is
indeed an instance of E89 Propositional Object.

Examples:
-  Maxwell&#8217;s Equations
-  The ideational contents of Aristotle&#8217;s book entitled &#8216;Metaphysics&#8217; as rendered in the
Greek texts translated in &#8230; Oxford edition&#8230;
-  The underlying prototype of any &#8220;no-smoking&#8221; sign (E36)
-  The common ideas of the plots of the movie &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot; by Akira Kurosawa and

Note, that the class E9 Move inherits the property P7 took place at (witnessed): E53 Place. This property should be used to describe the trajectory or a larger area within which a moven takes place, whereas the properties P26 moved to (was destination of), P27 moved from (was origin of) describe the start and end points only. Moves may also be documented to consist of other moves (via P9 consists of (forms part of)), in order to describe intermediate stages on a trajectory. In that case, start and end points of the partial moves should match appropriately between each other and with the overall event.

Examples: the relocation of London Bridge from the UK to the USA; the movement of the exhibition &quot;Treasures of Tutankhamun&quot; 1976-1979.</rdfs:comment>

identifiers, traffic signs, emblems, texts, data sets, images, musical scores, multimedia objects,
computer program code or mathematical formulae that have an objectively recognizable

include human memory, and it can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. An instance
of E90 Symbolic Object may or may not have a specific meaning, for example an arbitrary
character string.
